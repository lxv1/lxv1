States for the "nickel" 3-cent piece (1865-89) and the "nickel" 5-cent

<br>Current Composition of U.S. Coins:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The yellow-colored coin, known as the
Golden
<br>Dollar, is mostly composed of copper (current London
<br>Metal Exchange price about $0.85 per pound), with some
<br>zinc (about $0.52 per pound), and nickel (about $3.40
<br>per pound). The coin weighs 8.1 grams (about 0.018
<br>pounds). Leaving out the cost of manganese (which
<br>isn't too expensive), the Golden Dollar is made of
<br>metals worth about one and one-half cents. Admittedly,
<br>high purity coin metal costs more, and other expenses
<br>- such as finding an artist who can invent a likeness
<br>of Sacagawea (and her child!) out of pure ether - also
<br>must be added in, but it's clearly not the metals that
<br>give today's coins their value.
<p>The guilt (or is it gilt?) of fashioning a faux gold
<br>coin does not rest solely with the U.S Mint. The 0.10,
<br>0.20, and 0.50 euro coins (the 10, 20, and 50 cent
<br>pieces of the nations participating in the European
<br>Monetary Union) are not real gold either, but are
<br>"Nordic Gold" whose composition is 89% copper, 5%
<br>aluminum, 5% zinc, and 1% tin. It seems that not an
<br>atom of gold is intentionally added into anyone's
<br>"golden" coins.

<p>The following is just some samples of information you
<br>can find there:
<p>Nickel Brass
<br>Alloy
<br>A copper alloy containing zinc and a small quantity of
<br>nickel which is used for the UK 'brass' threepenny bit
<br>and the pound coin. The composition used for the
<br>threepenny bit was 79% Cu, 20% Zn and 1% Ni, while
<br>that for the pound coin and early single metal two
<br>pound coins is 70% Cu, 24.5% Zn and 5.5% Ni. The outer
<br>ring of the bimetallic two pound coin is 76% Cu, 20%
<br>Zn and 4% Ni.
<p>Nickel Silver
<br>Alloy
<br>A copper alloy containing 18-22% nickel, 15-20% zinc
<br>and sometimes manganese and other metals which is made
<br>with a wide variety of compositions.
<p>The alloy is sometimes known as German Silver or
<br>Argentan
