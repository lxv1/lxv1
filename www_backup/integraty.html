facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized
possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously
used without informing the instructor, or tampering with the academic work
of other students. For any material or ideas obtained from other sources,
such as the text or things you see on the web, in the library, etc., a
source reference must be given. Direct quotes from any source must be identified
as such. All exam answers must be your own, and you must not provide any
assistance to other students during exams. Any instances of academic dishonesty

<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=+0>Academic dishonesty
is not limited to simply cheating on an exam or assignment. The following
is quoted directly from the "PSU Faculty Senate Policies for Students"
regarding academic integrity and academic dishonesty: "Academic integrity
is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and
is an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes,
but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating of information
or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having
unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person
or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering
with the academic work of other students." All University and Eberly College
of Science policies regarding academic integrity/academic dishonesty apply
to this course and the students enrolled in this course. Refer to the following
URL for further details on the academic integrity policies of the Eberly
College of Science: http://www.science.psu.edu/academic/Integrity/index.html.
Each student in this course is expected to work entirely on her/his own
while taking any exam, to complete assignments on her/his own effort without
the assistance of others unless directed otherwise by the instructor, and
to abide by University and Eberly College of Science policies about academic
integrity and academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty can result in assignment
of "F" by the course instructors or "XF" by Judicial Affairs as the final
grade for the student.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=+0><b>Statement
4</b> (used in a course that only has exams):</font></font>
<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size=+0>In an examination
setting, unless the instructor gives explicit prior instructions to the
contrary, violations of academic integrity shall consist of any attempt
to receive assistance from written or printed aids, from any person or
papers or electronic devices, or of any attempt to give assistance, whether
the student doing so has completed his or her own work or not. Other violations
include, but are not limited to, any attempt to gain an unfair advantage
in regard to an examination, such as tampering with a graded exam or claiming
another's work to be one's own. Failure to comply will lead to sanctions
against the student in accordance with the <a href="http://www.science.psu.edu/academic/Integrity/index.html">Policy
on Academic Dishonesty</a> in the Eberly College of Science.</font></font>

<p>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT
<br>Mathematics Department
<br>&nbsp;
<p>"Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing,
. . .
<br>facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized
prior
<br>possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work
previously
<br>used without informing the instructors, or tampering with the academic
work of
<br>other students . . . .&nbsp; A student charged with academic dishonesty
will be given
<br>oral or written notice of the charge by the instructor.&nbsp; If students
believe they
<br>have been falsely accused, they should seek redress through informal
discussions
<br>with the instructor, department head, dean or campus executive officer.&nbsp;
If the
<br>instructor believes that the infraction is sufficiently serious to
warrant the
<br>referral of the case to Judicial Affairs, or if the instructor will
award a final
<br>grade of F in the course because of the infraction, the student and
instructor will
<br>be afforded formal due process."
