<p>Not only are the Fountains of Bellagio considered the best overall attraction
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; in Las Vegas, it is also free! Considering the fountains
are set in an
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; eight-acre lake directly in front of the hotel along the
Las Vegas Strip, it
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; would be difficult to charge its viewers admission. Don't
think we don't
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; appreciate the free show though!

<p>Cirque du Soleil's two shows, "O" at Bellagio and "Mystere" at Treasure
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Island are back on top this year with "O" narrowly beating
"Mystere." Last
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; year's winner, Blue Man Group, at the Luxor, came in third.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Studio 54 at the MGM Grand came in a very close
second to Ra at the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Luxor as the Best Nightclub for Singles, evidently the
couples in Las Vegas
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; think that Studio 54 is the best one for them. Studio
54 is one of the
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; largest clubs in the city and features several semi-private
lounges. We are
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; betting this is why the couples find it so inviting.
<p>Michael Parrish, who performs in the Houdini Lounge at the Monte Carlo,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; covers Sinatra to Van Halen. It probably doesn't hurt
that popular magician
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lance Burton, who is in the same hotel, gives Parrish
a nice little plug at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; the end of his show. Parrish began performing in Las Vegas
in July 2000 after
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; being named Entertainer of the Year for three years in
Kansas City, Mo.

<p><a href="lasvegas.show.html">show</a>&nbsp; Siegfried and Roy,&Acirc;
Vegas' most depressing casino,&nbsp;&nbsp; and other lowlights from the
Strip.&nbsp;&nbsp; diary
<br>Chris Mohney, travel writer, April 5, 2002, 10:02 |
<p>`TEASE'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (B) The off-Broadway format of this
otherwise spotty musical comedy makes it a refreshing addition to the Strip.
It's a theatrical musical about a topless club, staged in a nightclub,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
casting its five female leads as strip-club dancers and giving them songs
to explain their characters. The 16 songs, 10 of them original, are more
accomplished than the skimpy story,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
but a strong cast makes the most of it. (1/18/02 M.W.) "Tease" will be
presented at 7 and 9:30 p.m. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays; and 9:30
p.m. Mondays and Fridays at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Insomnia. $39.95-$59.95. 3663 Las Vegas Blvd. South. 699-9196.
<br>&lt;The formula for this new&nbsp; wave of Vegas topless shows went
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
something like: 6 half-naked dancers + 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C-list soft-porn
celebrity + 1 passable
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
singer + bad dance-pop + cornball jokes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + inane
framing concept +
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
bargain-basement lounge act = 1 fully&nbsp;&nbsp; realized load of crap.
<br>Tease is head, shoulders, and cleavage&nbsp; above the crop I saw last
year. > Chris Mohney
<p>BLUE MAN GROUP: LIVE AT LUXOR'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(A) Weird, but also wildly inventive and universally funny is this New
York-based troupe that picked Las Vegas for its fourth and biggest production.
When they're not pounding on
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PVC pipe, three silent pranksters in skullcaps and blue greasepaint combine
highbrow humor and schoolyard play-with-your-food tricks, old-fashioned
sleight-of-hand and genuine
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
efforts to explain science and nature. The minimalist, industrial look
and an aggressive, percussive score may scare some away, but a new generation
of showgoer is more likely to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
appreciate its unique point of view. (3/24/00 M.W.) "Blue Man Group: Live
at Luxor" will be presented at 7 and 10 p.m. Sundays, Mondays, Wednesdays
through Fridays; 7 p.m.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tuesdays and 4, 7 and 10 p.m. Saturdays in the Luxor Theater at the Luxor.
$71.50-$82.50. 3900 Las Vegas Blvd. South. 262-4400.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>`SIEGFRIED &amp; ROY'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(A) This lavish and groundbreaking production starring the German-born
magicians and longtime Las Vegans remains unequaled via its theatrical
scope, and world-class staging and
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lighting design. The duo's signature white lions and tigers are an added
lure to an illusion-packed extravaganza that pits the heroes against fire-breathing
dragons and other evil
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
forces. However, the good guys prevail with remarkable escapes and supplement
their shining knight heroism with well-executed magical feats that continue
to enrapture audiences.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Siegfried &amp; Roy" will be presented at 7:30 p.m. Sundays through Tuesdays
and 7:30 and 11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays in the Siegfried &amp; Roy Theatre
at The Mirage. $100.50, includes
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
two drinks and a souvenir program. 3400 Las Vegas Blvd. South. 792-7777.
