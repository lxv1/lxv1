<br>Three midterms in class are given, about 75 pts each. Extra pts are
given for

maximal scores.
<br>Here are lower limits for other grades:
<br>A- 86 2/3 %,
<br>B+ 83 1/3 %,
<br>B 80 %,
<br>B-&nbsp; 76 2/3 %,

<br>C&nbsp; 70%,
<br>D 60%.
<br>No make-ups are given for missing tests in class unless e-mail sent
to
<br>vstein@math.psu.edu
<br>before the class.
<br>Late homework is accepted and partial credit for late homework is given
(until graded papers are returned).
<br>Computers, books, notes are allowed during tests, but no joint work.
<br>No points are given after classes are over.
