<br>textbook:&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Linear Algebra with Applications </i>by Bretscher,
Prentice Hall&nbsp; 2001.
<br>100% = 272 pts on&nbsp; Dec. 13.
<br>Send evaluations to me by e-mail.
<p><b>First class (August 28):</b>
<br>Examples of linear systems.
<br>What is a solution?
<br>What is a linear equation?
<br>What are equivalent systems? (the same solutions)
<br>Solving ax=b for x.
<p><b>Second class (August 30).</b>
<br>Why they are called linear?
<br>Solving an arbitrary system of linear equations.
<p><b>Sept 4.</b>
<br>Answer in standard form (no changes of variables). Three cases:
<br>0=1 (no solutions).
<br>the variables = numbers (unique solution).
<br>distinct variables = linear functions in the other variables (at least
one) + numbers&nbsp; (infinetely many solutions).
<br>We do not use echelon forms. We drop zero columns and zero rows.
<br>Examples.
<br>Matrix addition and multiplication. Matrix representation of a system
of linear equations, <i>Ax=b</i>.
<br>Homework, due Friday, 4:40 pm. Exercises 1--5 in Section 1.1; 5 problems,
5 pts each.
<br>Linear&nbsp; combinations and relations.
<br>Linear dependence and independence.
<p><b>Sept 6.&nbsp; </b>Chapter 2.<b> </b>Linear and affine transformations.
<br>Linear and affine transformations of plane.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Sept 9.</b> Invertible affine transformation.
<br>The transformation&nbsp;&nbsp; x -> Ax+b is invertible iff the matrix
A is invertible.
<br>The inverse, if exists, is&nbsp; an affine transformation.
<br>To prove the "only if" part we simplify the transformation&nbsp; composing
it with invertible
<br>transformations. First we drop b, then we make A&nbsp; an identity
matrix possibly augmented by zero columns and/or columns. This part does
not use the assumption that&nbsp;&nbsp; transformations is invertible.
Using the assumption,
<br>we see that there are no zero rows or columns, i.e., A is the
<br>identity matrix. Now it is clear that A is invertible.
<br>Homework was given, 25 pts due W.
<p><b>Sept 13.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; Kernel and image of a linear transformation.&nbsp;
Dimension of vector subspace.
<p><b>Sept 16.</b>&nbsp; Bases,&nbsp; coordinates. Vector spaces.
<br>Homework was given, 20 pts due W. Ex. 2 from each of 4 sections in
Chapter 3.
<p><b>Sept 18.</b> Chapter 4.
<p>The row operations do not change the row space and relations between&nbsp;
the columns.
<br>The column operations do not change the column space and relations
between the rows.
<br>So the row and column&nbsp; do not chage the dimensions of the column
and row space of
<br>a matrix. Therefore, both dimesions are the same (and equal to the
rank
<br>of the matrix).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Sept 25.</b> W. <a href="F02a.m1.html">midterm&nbsp;</a> .&nbsp;
min = 10, average = 32, max = 50.
<p><b>Sept . 27.</b> F. Midterm discussion. The grader thought that it
was 5 pts&nbsp; per problem, so scores
<br>for the midterm should be doubled. Many students still cannot solve&nbsp;
ax=b (see the first class).
<br>rank(diagonal matrix) = # nonzero entries.
<p><b>Sept.30</b>.&nbsp; M. Chapter 5. Homework due W, 5 problems, 5 pts
each. page 190. #2, 4, 6, 8. Page 199., #10.
<p>h4:&nbsp; min=15, av.=23, max=25 pts.
<p><b>Oct 7.</b> Homework due W, Oct 9: page 222: 16,18,20,22,26.
<br>5 problems, 5 points each.

<p>M&nbsp; Dec 2, hmw 10 pts due, #35 on page 374. Hints:
<br>compute the eigenvalues of the <i>m</i> by <i>m</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; matrix&nbsp;
with all entries 1 (most of them are zeros);
<br>(answer: since the rank of this matrix is 1, only one eigenvalue&nbsp;
can be nonzero;&nbsp; since the trace is <i>m</i>, this eigenvalue is <i>m</i>);
<br>consider the Gram matrix (the matrix of all dot products of given <i>n</i>+1
vectors).
<br>Since the vectors are linearly dependend, the determinant of the Gram
matrix is 0.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>W, Dec. 4. We did Section 9.2.
<br>The derivative (<i>e<sup>A</sup></i>)' of&nbsp; <i>e<sup>A&nbsp;</sup></i>
where <i>A</i> is a differetiable&nbsp; square matrix, is&nbsp; <i>A</i>'
<i>e<sup>A</sup></i>
<br>when <i>A</i> and <i>A</i>' commute. What is they do not commute? (work
on this for bonus points).
