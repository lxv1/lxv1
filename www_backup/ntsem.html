   </p>
     
<p>Let $\pi$ be an automorphic representation of a split reductive algebraic 
 group $G$ over a number field $F$.  Langlands has associated to $G$ a complex 
 Lie group $^LG$, and defined, for every finite dimensional representation 
 $r$ of $^LG$, an $L$-function $L(\pi,r,s),$ which is conjectured to have 
analytic properties similar to those of the Riemann zeta function and/or Dirichlet
$L$-functions, and contain interesting information about the representation 
 $\pi.$  In the Rankin-Selberg method, analytic properties of $L$-functions 
 are proved by expressing the $L$-functions in terms of integrals containing 
 Eisenstein series, whose analytic properties are known.  We will consider 
 a new integral on the similitude orthogonal group GSO(8), in which the representations 
 $r$ that arise are the standard and half-spin representations of SO(8,C), 
 and use it to relate poles of $L$-functions with the existence of a non-trivial 
 functorial lift to the exceptional group $G_2.$<br>

<p><i><b>Two elementary results concerning rational polynomials </b></i><br>
          </p>
     
<p>The two elementary results in the title are part of my recent work. Both have to do with the wonderful fact that in polynomials with integer coefficients both the coefficients and the powers are taken from essentially the same set. Most of the talk will be accessible to most graduate students.<br>  
       <p>The first result is the following theorem.<br>

<p>Theorem. A polynomial with rational coefficients divides a derivative of the polynomial which is split over rationals if and only if all of its irrational roots are real and simple.<br>

    <p>I will explain the motivation as well as the proof of this result, which resembles the famous three point theorem of Belyj.  The second result is related to the classification of the set of solutions of the system of functional equations satisfied by the so-called quantum integers with respect to multiplication.<br>

<p><i><b>Universal algebra of pseudo-roots of non-commutative polynomialsa
and non-commutative  symmetric functions<br>
</b></i></p>
<p>A generic monic polynomial $P(t)\in R[t]$ where $R$ is a (non-commutative)
division ring admits many different facotrizations into a product of linear
polynomials $t-a$.  Elements $a$ are called pseudo-roots of $P(t)$ and may
be considered as generators of a quadratic algebra.  This algebra has a deep
structure.  I will talk about this structure anbd its relations to other
problems.<br>
