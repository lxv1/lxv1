establish a rigorous algebraic formalism of conformal field 
theory.  They are also extremely useful in the study of 
infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and their representations.
 
I will define conformal algebras, explain their relation to 
vertex algebras and superconformal algebras of string theory, and 
describe recent progress and conjectures in the field.

admit multiplication from an order of a real quadratic field, and show that
under some constraints these jacobians have no other endomorphisms over the
algebraic closure of the ground field (with some exceptions in positive
characteristic).

infinite families of generalized Lambert series identities,
and deduce several known identities from them. They include an
identity due to M. Jackson, a corollary of Ramanujan's
$_1\psi_1$ summation formula, and a recent identity of G. E.
Andrews, R. P. Lewis, and Z.-G. Liu.
Next, we show that the same method also leads to new proofs of
Ramanujan's $_1\psi_1$ summation formula and Sears' general
transformation of basic hypergeometric series.

 </i><br></b>  </td></tr>  
<tr><td> <b>Abstract: </b> </td> <td> In 1938 D. H. Lehmer asserted (without proof) that for a prime number p, 
if A_p(n) = 0, then A_mp(n) = 0 for m = 2, 3, ..., where A_k(n) is the k-th term of Rademacher's formula for the partition 
function p(n).

In our talk, we will discuss a vanishing conjecture, which is more general than D. H. Lehmer's assertion, for 
the terms of Rademacher's formula for p(n).

We discovered our conjecture in 1997 and until last summer we thought that it has been proved by others, 
but it seems not. 

This conjecture is very useful in reducing computation time a lot for computing p(n) using Rademacher's formula for it, 
especially when n is large. Cf. http://trinitas.mju.ac.kr/intro2numbpart.html

<tr><td> <b>Abstract: </b> </td> 
 <td> The talk will be divided equally between two unrelated topics. The first
one concerns the surprising connection between some special curves in
3-space and the abc polynomials. It was discovered recently as a by-product
of a question of J. Harris. It yielded a nice little problem that was open
for several weeks until ultimately solved by N. Elkies.  It  leads to a
natural generalization of the abc polynomial construction that deserves
further study.  In the second part of the talk I will explain a connection between
some families of cyclic quotient singularities and the integer ratios of factorials,
through a classical theorem of Landau. I will discuss some known results
and open questions arising from this connection.

   <tr><td><br><b> Title:  <br></b> </td> <td><br><b> <i>Algebraic constructions for sets of partially orthogonal latin squares and projective planes </i><br></b>  </td></tr>  
<tr><td> <b>Abstract: </b> </td> <td> 
This is joint work with A.D. Keedwell (University of Surrey)

 We investigate the construction of sets of latin squares of a given non-prime power order $q$ which are as close 
as possible to being mutually orthogonal sets.  Using uniform cyclic neofields, for any even $q&gt;2$ we are able to construct 
$q-1$ latin squares of order $q$ with the property that, when we juxtapose any two of them, we obtain $5q-4$ 
distinct ordered pairs. More precisely, we obtain $4q-3$ ordered pairs that occur exactly once, $q-1$ pairs that occur 
exactly $q-3$ times, and $q^2-5q+4$ pairs that do not occur.

Thus for example in the case when $q=6$ and there is not even a pair of orthogonal latin squares  of order 6, we are able to 
construct 5 latin squares of order 6 so that when any two of them are juxtaposed, we obtain 26 distinct ordered pairs. 
And when $q=10$, using a uniform cyclic neofield we are able to construct 9 latin squares of order 10 with the property that 
when any two of them are juxtaposed we obtain 46 distinct ordered pairs. 

It is conjectured, and very likely true, that $D$-neofields exist for any finite order $q$ except for $q=2,6$. In cases where 
a $D$-neofield exists, one can do even better. For example when $q=10$, we can construct 9 latin squares of order 10 
so that of the total possible $\binom {9} {2} 10^2 =3600$ possible ordered pairs in a complete set of 9 MOLS of order 10, 
we obtain 2952 distinct ordered pairs. This represents 82\% of the total possible pairs in a complete set.

<tr><td> <b>Abstract: </b> </td> <td> We will first prove an "intermediate value theorem" with an arithmetic
flavor, involving the consecutive averages of a sequence (a result 
obtained jointly with Laurence D. Robinson). Some other results on 
sequences will be discussed, including an analysis of a class of 
'entangled' Lucas configurations. Finally, a linearized version of a 
result by Conway and Gordon will be provided. Conway and Gordon proved 
in 1983 that any spatial embedding of the complete graph with six 
vertices contains a pair of linked triangles. We will address the case 
of linear (straight-line) embeddings and we will see that every such 
embedding has either 1 or 3 pairs of linked triangles.

<tr><td> <b>Abstract: </b> </td> <td> An overpartition of the nonnegative integer n is a partition 
of n wherein the first occurrence of parts of each size may be 
overlined.   Several mathematicians, including S. Corteel, J. Lovejoy, 
K. Mahlburg, and A. Yee have studied the function which enumerates 
overpartitions.   In this talk, I will discuss a number of results that 
have been proven in the last two months during a fruitful collaboration 
with Mike Hirschhorn.

<tr><td> <b>Abstract: </b> </td> <td>  Let G be a p-adic group and V1, V2, V3 be three admissible irreducible
representations of G. Let V be the tensor product of V1, V2, and V3. The
space of G-invariant linear forms on V is known to be of dimension at most
one. When it is exactly one, finding a vector whose image is not zero is a
natural question. Such a vector is called a test vector. Gross and Prasad
could find test vectors for certain triples of representations.

Inspired by recent papers of Bernstein ans Reznikov, I would like to find
some explicit test vectors in order to get estimates of local factors of
triple products of automorphic forms. Those triple products are related to
the behaviour of some L-function on the critical line.

Functions </i><br></b>  </td></tr>  
<tr><td> <b>Abstract: </b> </td> <td> The Rogers-Ramanujan identities are among the most famous 
identities in combinatorics.  Late in his stay in England, Ramanujan 
derived 40 further identities relating the two Rogers-Ramanujan functions 
at different arguments.  Although almost all of the forty  identities  have 
now been proved,  principally by L. J. Rogers, G. N. Watson, D. Bressoud, 
and A. J. F. Biagioli, an impenetrable fog still lies over the ideas which 
led Ramanujan to derive these identities.  In the past four years, a group of 
mathematicians of order 8 have been attempting to find proofs of Ramanujan's 40 
identities in the spirit of Ramanujan's mathematics.  At this moment, we have 
proofs of thirty-five of the identities that could have been given by Ramanujan. 
 For the remaining five identities, we have found nonrigorous arguments using 
asymptotic analysis to establish the identities.  It is likely that Ramanujan 
utilized asymptotic methods to discover some, perhaps many, of his identities.  
In this lecture, we discuss the various methods used to deduce the 40 
identities.

conjectured in 1996 that a multiple zeta value is reducible if the weight

Tsumura, by using mainly power series manipulations.  My aim is to
generalize this theorem to multiple L-values by using the monodromies of
multiple polylogarithms associated to Dirichlet characters.

   <tr><td><br><b> Title:  <br></b> </td> <td><br><b> <i>Somos Sequences
 </i><br></b>  </td></tr>  
<tr><td> <b>Abstract: </b> </td> <td>  In the early nineties Michael Somos asked for the inner meaning of the 
fact that the quadratic recursions 
$$C_{h-2}C_{h+2}=C_{h-1}C_{h+1}+C_{h}^2$$
and $$B_{h-2}B_{h+3}=B_{h-1} B_{h+2} + B_{h}B_{h+1}$$
are respectively satisfied by the bi-directional sequences $\ldots\,$, 
$2$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $2$, $3$,$7$, $23$, $59$, $\ldots\,$ and 
$\ldots\,$, 3$, $2$, $1$,
$1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $5$, $11$, $37$, $83$, $\ldots\,$, 
surprisingly consisting entirely of integers [which incidentally, 
increase at a hefty clip: the log of their $h$-th term is $O(h^2)$ as 
$h\to\infty$].

In the meantime I had found quite independent reason for studying the 
continued fraction expansion of square roots of polynomials. 
Nonetheless, I found that those expansions inter alia produce sequences 
of integers satisfying quadratic recursions of Somos type. For 
instance, the sequence $(C_h)$ [called $4$-Somos by some of its 
friends] reports the denominators of a sequence of points on the 
quartic curve $Y^2=(X^2-3)^2+4(X-2)$, equivalently of the points 
$M+hS$, with $M=(-1,1)$, $S=(0,0)$ on the cubic curve 
$V^2-V=U^3+3U^2+2U$. Indeed all Somos~$4$ and Somos~$5$ sequences are 
`elliptic sequences' in such a sense.

I will tell the story from very first principles and will mention 
generalisations. Thus, again for instance, the sequence $\ldots\,$, 
$2$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $8$, $17$, 
$50$,$\ldots\,$ given by the recursion 
$B_{h-3}B_{h+3}=B_{h-2}B_{h+2}+B_{h}^2$ arises from adding multiples of 
the class of the divisor at infinity on the Jacobian of the curve 
$Y^2=(X^3-4X+1)^2+4(X-2)$ of genus~$2$ to the class of the divisor 
given by $[(\varphi,0),(\overline\varphi,0)]$; here, no doubt to the 
joy of adherents to the cult of Fibonacci, $\varphi$ denotes the 
golden ratio.

In calmer words, I detail the continued fraction expansion of the square
root of  a monic  polynomials of even degree. I note that each step
of the expansion corresponds to addition of the divisor at
infinity, and interpret the data yielded by the general expansion.
In the quartic and sextic cases I observe explicitly that the
parameters  appearing in the continued fraction expansion yield
integer sequences defined by bilinear relations instancing sequences
of Somos type.
