<p><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Projective embeddings of some
modular curves</font></i></b>
<p>For fixed values of the parameter $\tau$, theta functions of one variable
$\theta[\chi](z,\tau)$ with characteristics $\chi$ can be used to study
elliptic function theory. The corresponding theta constants $\theta[\chi](0,\tau)$
can be used to study function theory on surfaces represented by the action
of subgroups of the modular group $\Gamma = \mbox{ PSL}(2,{\bf Z})$ on
the upper half plane. Theta functions with integer (and, slightly more
generally, half integer) characteristics have been studied classically.
One is able to get more insight by consideringtheta functions with rational
characteristics.
<p>Let $\Gamma(k)$ be the level $k$ (assume for simplicity that $k$ is
an odd integer) principal congruence subgroup acting on the upper half
plane ${\bf H}^2$. Let $X_k$ be the compactification of ${\bf H}^2/\Gamma(k)$
obtained by filling in the punctures. We discuss projective embeddings
of $X_k$ using modifications of theta constants with characteristics of
the form $\left [\begin{array}{c} \frac{2l+1}{k} \\ 1 \end{array} \right
]$ and related automorphic forms constructed from derivatives of theta
functions.

<p><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Zeta Measures over Function
Fields</font></i></b>
<p>Let A be integral domain of polynomials over a finite field of r elements.
A is taken as an analogue of the ring of rational integers, with the "positive"
elements in A being the monic polynomials. As an analogue of the zeta function
over Z, the zeta function over A can be defined, and it is known that it
can be analytically continued to a "complex plane" . In this talk, we will
present some recent results in the measure theory of function fields and
applications to the zeta function over A.

<p><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Coverings of curves with asymptotically
many rational points</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Infinite families of curves defined
over a finite field $F_q$ of $q$ elements containing many rational points
can be used to construct good long algebraic geometry codes. Denote by
$N_q(g)$ the maximum possible number of rational points contained in a
curve of genus $g$ defined over $F_q$. Ihara introduced the quantity $A(q)$
which is the limsup of the&nbsp; quotient $N_q(g)/g$ as the genus $g$&nbsp;
approaches infinity. Drinfeld and Vladut proved that $A(q) \le \sqrt q$.
On the other hand, the work of Ihara, Tsfasman, Vladut and Zink showed
that $A(q) = \sqrt q$ when $q$ is a square. Much less is known when $q$
is not a square. In this talk we'll review known optimal constructions
and present new lower bounds for $A(q)$ with $q$ nonsquare, in joint work
with Hiren Maharaj.</font>

a new expression for the generalized Vandermonde determinant (GVD) ${a}_{\lambda+\delta}$
and thus for the Schur function defined by $s_{\lambda} = \frac{a_{\lambda+\delta}}{a_{\delta}}$.&nbsp;
This expression contains a vector sum of elementary symmetric polynomials.&nbsp;
First the case GVD with two deleted rows is treated and then a formula
for an arbitrary GVD is proved by induction.&nbsp; It would be interesting
to try to extend this formula to arbitrary</font>

the process we also obtain an equivalence relation on the set of all GVD.</font>

<p><b><i>Maps and Character Sums on Finite Fields</i></b>
<p>Recent research on cyclic difference sets has uncovered some surprising
connections with more traditional objects of study such as Gauss and Jacobi
sums, Dickson (and exceptional) polynomials and quadratic forms as well
as with some fundamental properties of BCH and 1st Order Reed-Muller codes.&nbsp;&nbsp;
We shall discuss a number of these results and raise some questions for
further research.

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Function fields in positive characteristic

Jing Yu has established a full analogue for t-modules of the Baker-Wuestholz
Theorem on the linear independence of logarithms in commutative algebraic
groups.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Unlike the classical case, the function
field case involves a variable in the&nbsp; base field.&nbsp; So Laurent
Denis had the idea of showing the linear independence of certain derivatives
(with respect to this variable) of the logarithm of the most basic t-module,
the Carlitz module.&nbsp; In joint work, we showed the linear independence
of all divided derivatives of any non-zero logarithm of an algebraic value
for any Drinfeld module.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Recently I was able to show the linear
independence of all divided derivatives of all coordinates of any non-zero
logarithm of a simple t-module (or a minimal extension thereof).</font>

<p><b><i>Unipotent representations of classical and differential Galois
groups</i></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Unipotent representations of the
absolute Galois group of a number field naturally appear in the study of
the $l$-adic realizations of a one-motive $M$. In his work on deficient
one-motives, K. Ribet showed that the image of these representations become
small when $M$ presents an `antisymmetric' autoduality.&nbsp; Similarly,
reducible differential operators $L= L_t...L_1$ yield unipotent representations
of differential Galois groups. We shall explain how the size of their image
reflects the `complexity' of the product, and (when $t=3$) that it becomes
small iff $L$ presents a 'symmetric' autoduality. We shall further explain
how Grothendieck's notion of blended extensions provides a uniform explanation
of these phenomena.</font>
