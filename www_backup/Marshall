Research of Robert Marshall relevant to potential Auction Center

The bulk of my research on auctions, and procurements, has concerned collusion by bidders. One side of the work has addressed the strategic behavior of colluding bidders within a given auction scheme. Another side of the work has addressed the comparative robustness of different auction schemes to collusion. A separate small vein of the work has been dedicated to the strategies a seller might use to combat collusion during an auction. There is also a small part of the work that addresses the appropriate application (from an economic perspective) of antitrust law to issues associated with bidder collusion. The techniques employed have been theoretical, numerical, and empirical. 

Note. Although there are many ``on-line'' auctions, issues associated specifically with them are currently not part of my research program (could be in the future).
