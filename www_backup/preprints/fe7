\centerline  {\bf 1 INTRODUCTION}
\medskip
The  Euler-Fermat equations are
  $$x_1^n+\cdots.+x_m^n=x_0^n \eqno(1.1) $$
  with unknown   $x_i.$  In 1769 Euler conjectured that  (1.1) has no positive integral solutions when $m <  n.$ This generalizes both his result for $n = 3$ and
  Fermat's Last  Theorem. However his conjecture was refuted for $m+1=n = 5$ [LP]  and
then  for $m+1=n = 4$ [E].
  It is still unknown whether  (1.1) has solutions with $ m+1=n \ge 6$ or with  $m=3=n-2.$
On the other hand,  (1.1) has positive
integral solutions for  $m \ge G(n)$ where $G(n)$ is a number related with the Waring problem,
whose best known bound for large $n$ is   $G(n) \le n(\log n + \log \log n + O(1))$ [Wo].

	   In this paper, we are looking for solutions 
in  $F[t]$ rather than in the integers. Here
    $F$ is a field of  characteristic    $p \ge 0$  and
   $F[t]$  is the polynomial ring in a variable $t$  with coefficients in  $F.$
% and  F(t)   the field of rational functions.
    
\smallskip
When char($F$) = 0, it is known that  (1.1) has no nontrivial solutions in $F[t]$ when  $m < (n/8)^{1/2}$   [NS]. {\it Nontrivial} here means  primitive, indecomposable, nonconstant.
A solution to  (1.1) (or to  the more general equation  (1.2) below)  is called
primitive if
gcd$(x_0,x_1,...,x_m)$ = 1. We call it indecomposable if no partial sum on the left hand side is 0. We call it nonconstant if not all $x_i$ belong to $F.$

\smallskip
When $p$ = char$(F) \ne 0,$ given any solution of  (1.1) we can obtain  solutions of a similar equation
with the same $m$ but $n$ replaced by $np,$ by taking the $p$-th  power. So in the case
of finite characteristic  we can have nontrivial solutions of  (1.1) with a 
small $m$  
and arbitrarily large $n.$ Moreover,  it is known that  (1.1) may
have  nontrivial solutions with $m = 3$ and all $n$ 
(including all $n$ coprime with $p$) [P]. 
Furthermore, even for any fixed   $x_0,$
 (1.1) with $m = 3$ may have nontrivial solutions with arbitrarily
large $n$ coprime with $p$ [V2]. See Section 5.

\smallskip

Returning to the case $p=0,$ we consider equations more general than (1.1),
  the generalized Fermat equations
  $$ c_0x_0^{n_0}+\cdots.+c_mx_m^{n_m}=0, \eqno (1.2) $$
 in $m+1$ unknowns $x_i$ with given  $n_i \ge 2$ and nonzero $c_i \in F.$ 
 Our goal  is to prove that  (1.2)
has no nontrivial solutions in $F[t]$ when $n_i$ are `large' in a certain sense.
   
It is stated in [NS, p.486]  where $F$ = {\bf C}, the complex numbers, that
when $m  \le (n/8)^{1/2},$ the equation
 (1.1)  has no solutions in $F[t]$ with nonconstant $x_i$ which are pairwise coprime.
 Actually, the method of [NS]  works when we  relax the above condition to the following condition:
 the solution must be be primitive, indecomposable and nonconstant.  
Moreover, this method, involving the Wronskian of $x_i,$ works to prove the following:

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Theorem 1.3.}  {\it Let} char($F$) = 0.  {\it Then 
 $(1.2)$ has no nontrivial solutions in $F[t]$  when  $\sum 1/n_j \le 1/(m-1)$ and
$0 \ne c_j \in F.$ In particular,  $(1.1)$ has no nontrivial solutions in $F[t]$  when
$n \ge  m^2 - 1.$}
\smallskip

Thus, this  relaxes  the condition $m  \le (n/8)^{1/2}$ of [NS]
to the condition $m  \le (n +1)^{1/2}.$ Proposition 5.2 of [DG] is our
Theorem 1.3 with the redundant condition that all $x_i$ are pairwise coprime.


On the other hand, it is shown in [NS, p.486] (with attribution to Molluzzo)
that  (1.1) has  a primitive nonconstant solution with an arbitrary $x_{0}$
when $m = [(4n + 1)^{1/2}]$ and $F = $ {\bf C}.
  Moreover, this solution works for any algebraically closed
field $F$ of any characteristic. It is still unknown even for  $F$ =  {\bf C}  whether  (1.1)   may have
nontrivial solutions when    $(n +1)^{1/2} <  m <[(4n + 1)^{1/2}].$

       We prove Theorem 1.3 after improving upon   results  of  [Vo], [BM], and [Z]  generalizing the   (abc)-theorem (see the next section). 
An interesting question outside the scope of the present paper is to 
establish a bound on the number of
nontrivial solutions of  (1.2) with given $c_i \in F[t]$
 for `large' $n_i.$ Results in this direction are known
when char($F$) = 0  (see [B], [BS], [Mu1], [Mu2])  or  char($F) \ne 0$ and  $m = 2$ [Vo2].

\bigskip
\centerline  {\bf 2  THE (abc)-THEOREM AND ITS GENERALIZATIONS}
\medskip

 For any nonzero polynomial  $f=f(t) \in F[t]$ let $\nu(f)$ denote the
number of $\alpha \in \bar F,$  an algebraic closure of $F,$ whose multiplicity in $f$ is not divisible by 
$p.$  When $p = $ char$(F) = 0, \nu(f)$ is just the number of distinct zeros 
of $f.$
 
\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Theorem 2.1.} {\it If   $a +b = c$ in $A = F[t]$ with $p=0,
\gcd(a, b) = 1$ and  $(abc)' \ne 0$ then $\deg(c) \le  \nu (abc) -1.$}
\smallskip
 
  This well-known theorem (see [Ma], [L]) implies that the Fermat equation $x^n + y^n = z^n$  has no nontrivial solutions in  $A=F[t]$ when $p =0$ and $n \ge 3$ (this was known before [NS], but in [NS] it was proved for $n \ge 32$).  It also has other applications [Mu1]. 

For $a,b, c$ as in Theorem 2.1, one can ask whether there are restrictions on  $N= \nu (abc), s= $ deg$(c) $
other than
the restrictions $s \le N-1$  given by the theorem and the obvious restrictions
$0 \le s$ and  $N \ge 2.$ It can be shown by examples that the answer is ``no"
when  char($F$) = 0, while the complete description of all possible pairs $(s,N$) in the case of $p \ne 0$ seems to be a difficult open problem.

Since we can switch $a$ or $b$ with -$c$ in Theorem 2.1, its conclusion can
be written  as follows:
max(deg($a$), deg($b$), deg($c))  \le  \nu (abc) -1.$
It follows from our Theorem 3.1 that
min(deg($a$), deg($b$), deg($c))  \le  \nu (abc) -2.$
On the other hand, it is clear that

$ \nu (abc) \le  \deg(a) + \deg(b)+ \deg(c)) \le 3\,$max(deg($a$), deg($b$), deg($c$)).

When char($F) = 0$, it can be shown by examples that  for any given integers
$M,s,N$ such that   $0 \le s \le M \le N-1$ and $s \le N-2 \le s +2M -2$
there are $a,b,c \in F[t]$ such that  deg($a$) = $s$, deg($b$) = deg($c) =M,$
$a+b=c,$ and $\nu(abc) = \nu(a) + \nu(b) + \nu(c) = N.$
A more general open problem is to describe all possible  6-tuples
(deg($a), \nu(a),$ deg($b), \nu(b),$ deg($c), \nu(c)$). This seems
to be a difficult problem even when  char($F$) = 0.

Here is our generalization of Theorem 2.1 in the case char($F$) = 0:

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Theorem 2.2.}  {\it Let} $m \ge 2, y_j \in A= F[t],  y_1+\cdots+y_m = y_0,\gcd(y_1,..., y_m) = 1, $   char($F) = 0,$   {\it  not all}  $y_j$ {\it are constants, and no nonempty  subsum  of}
$y_1,..., y_m$
{\it vanishes. Then:}

(a) deg$(y_0) <  (m-1)(\sum_{j=0}^m \nu (y_j)),$

(b) deg$(y_0) \le  (\nu(y_0...y_m)-1)m(m-1)/2 .$
\smallskip

We will obtain the theorem in Sections 3  and 4 below as a corollary of more precise results.  Namely, 
we  will prove the theorem first in the case when  $y_1,..., y_m$ are linearly
independent over $F$ (see Theorem 3.1 below which is an improved version
of Theorem 2.2 in this case) and then in the case when 
 $y_1,..., y_m$ are linearly
dependent over $F$ (see Theorem 4.1 below which is a more precise version of Theorem  2.2(b) and  Corollary 4.8  below which is a more precise version of Theorem  2.2(a)).

Part (b) was  first stated   in [Ma], first proved  in [BM, Theorem B]
(with $\nu(y_0...y_m)$ instead of $\nu(y_0...y_m)-1$)
 and then  proved in a more  precise form  in [Z].  In the case when  $y_1,..., y_m$ are linearly
independent over $F,$  Theorem 2.2 is a particular case (with $g=0$) of results
of [BM] and [Vo1] (although part(a) is not stated there explicitly).
It is unknown whether the number  $m(m-1)/2$ in (b) can be replaced by a smaller number when $m \ge 4.$ It is proved in [BB] that the correct number must be
at least $2m-3$ and conjectured   (and proved for $m=3$) that the  number is $2m-3$.

In the case $m = 2$ then both (a) and (b) coincide with
Theorem 2.1 with $p=0,$ because in this case we have   $\nu(y_0y_1y_2) =
\nu(y_0) +\nu(y_1) +\nu(y_2)$ and  $1 = m-1=m(m-1)/2.$

Note also that (a) implies Theorem 1.3. Indeed,
  by obvious symmetry of the equation $y_1+\cdots+y_m = y_0,$
the number  deg$(y_0)$ in Theorem 2.2 can be replaced by  deg$(y_j)$ for 
any $j$ and hence by $M$ = max$_j\deg(y_j).$ 
Dividing (a) by $M,$ we obtain that
$$1 <(m-1)\sum_{i=0}^m \nu(y_i)/M \le  (m-1)\sum_{j=0}^m \nu(y_j)/\deg(y_j).$$

The number  deg($y_j)/\nu(y_j)$ is the arithmetic mean of multiplicities of zeros of $y_i$ while $(m+1)/\sum_{i=0}^m \nu(y_i)/\deg(y_i)$ is 
the harmonic average 
of deg($y_j)/\nu(y_j).$  

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Corollary 2.3.} {\it Under the conditions of Theorem $2.2,$
the harmonic mean of 

\noindent $\deg(y_j)/\nu(y_j)$ is less than $m^2 -1.$}  
\smallskip

This corollary generalizes Theorem 1.3. (Applying the corollary to the case  $y_0=-c_0x^{n_0},
y_i=c_jx_j^{n_j}$ for $j \ge 1,$ we obtain Theorem 1.3.)
\bigskip
\centerline  {\bf 3 IMPROVING UPON THEOREM 2.2 }
\centerline  {\bf IN THE LINEARLY INDEPENDENT CASE}            
 \medskip
In this section we assume that char($F$) = 0. Our main goal is to prove 
Theorem  2.2 in the case when  $y_1,..., y_m$ are linearly
independent over $F.$ 
 In fact we state and prove  a more  precise version of  Theorem  2.2, Theorem 3.1, involving the orders  ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$ 
We also obtain some known results as corollaries of Theorem 3.1.

   First of all, for any integer $d \ge 1$ and any sequence  $k_1,...., k_d$  of integers we will define its ``diversity" $\Delta(k_1,...,k_d)$,
which is an integer between 0 and  $(d-1)d/2.$ 
Namely, we consider the set  $X$ of all
sequences  $l_1,...., l_d$ of distinct integers such that $l_j \ge k_j$ for all
$j$s. Then   $\Delta(k_1,...,k_d)$, our
diversity of  $ k_1,...., k_d,$ is the maximal value
of  $(d-1)d/2 -\sum_{j=1}^d (l_j-k_j).$ In other words, we compute the minimal total increase to make all  $k_j$ distinct and then subtract it from
its maximal possible value,  $(d-1)d/2.$ 
 It is clear that 
$0 \le   \Delta(k_1,...,k_d) \le (d-1)d/2.$
(To see the first inequality, note that  $\{k_j+j\} \in X$ when 
$\{k_j\}$ is nondecreasing.) It is also clear that      $\Delta(k_1,...,k_d)
=0$  if and only if  $\{k_j\} $ is a constant sequence and that 
 $\Delta(k_1,...,k_d) = (d-1)d/2$  if and only if all $k_j$ are distinct. Here 
are  two other  easy
upper bounds for $\Delta(k_1,...,k_d)$:
  $$\Delta(k_1,...,k_d) \le \sum_{j=1}^d \min(j-1,k_j-k_1)$$
 when  $k_1 \le... \le k_d$ and 
  $$\Delta(k_1,...,k_d) \le (d-1)d/2 - \sum _s(m_s-1)m_s/2,$$
 where  $m_s$ is the total number of $j$s such that  $k_j = s.$
 
    Now let  $y_1,..., y_d \in F[t]$ be linearly independent over $F,$
and we set $y_0 = y_1+\cdots+ y_d.$  For every    $\alpha \in \bar F$ let $k_0 \le ... \le k_d$ be the numbers 
ord$_{\alpha}(y_j) \  (0 \le j \le d)$ written in  nondecreasing order. We set
$$\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_d) = \Delta(k_1,...,k_d).$$  

Similarly,
let    $k_0 \le ... \le k_d$ be the numbers 
$\{$ord$_{\infty}(y_j) = -\deg(y_j): 0 \le j \le d\}$ 
 written in  nondecreasing order. We set
$$\Delta_{\infty}(y_1,..., y_d) = \Delta(k_1,...,k_d). $$

Thus, $\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_d)$ is defined for all $\alpha \in 
 P^1(\bar F) = \bar F \cup \{\infty\}$. For almost all $\alpha$ (all but finitely many)  ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)  = 0$ hence   $\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_d)$ = 0.


\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Theorem 3.1.} {\it Let} $m \ge 2, y_j \in A= F[t],  y_1+\cdots+y_m = y_0,\gcd(y_1,..., y_m) = 1, $   char($F) = 0,$ {\it and assume that
$y_1,...., y_m$ are linearly independent over $F.$
Then }  
$$\deg(y_0) \le -(m-1)m +\sum_{\alpha \in  P^1(\bar F)} \Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_m)$$
$$ \le -(m-1)m/2 + (m-1)\min(\nu(y_0...y_m)m/2, \sum_{j=0}^m\nu(y_j)).$$
 
    Note that  $\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_m) \ne 0$ if and only if 
either  $\alpha$ is a zero of $y_0...y_m$ (recall that gcd($y_1,...,y_m)=1$)
or $ \alpha = \infty$ and 
not all deg($y_j$) are the same. Therefore 

$$\deg(y_0) \le ({\rm card}(S) -2)m(m-1)/2$$ 
 when $S$ is a finite subset in $P^1(\bar F)$
and all $y_j$ are units outside $S.$ Thus, our Theorem 3.1 contains Theorem 4 of [Vo] (which is essentially  the same as Corollary 1 of [BM]) with $g=0.$
Moreover   $\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_m) \le (m-1)m/2 - (l-2)(l-1)/2$ where
$l$ is the number of $j$s with ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$ taking a fixed value.  (In the case when
this value is not minimal, $(l-2)(l-1)/2$ can be replaced by $(l-1)l/2.$)
Therefore
 our Theorem 3.1 contains Theorem A of [BM] with $g=0.$ Moreover, the number $S$ of places $\alpha$ where not all ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$  are 0 in [BM] and [Vo] can be replaced
by the number $S' \le S$  of places $\alpha$ where not all ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$ 
  are the same.

 Theorem 3.1 gives Theorem 2.2
in the case when  the polynomials $y_1,...., y_m $ in Theorem 2.2 are linearly independent (just use that $\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_m)  \le  m(m-1)/2$
for all  $\alpha$ to get Theorem 2.2 (b) and that
$\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_m)  \le  (m-1)\{\# j: $ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)  \ne 0\}).$


 After   Theorem 3.1 is proved we will obtain some known results as its consequences, and then, in the next section, we use
it to prove   an improved version of Theorem 2.2, Theorem 4.1.


To prove Theorem 3.1, we introduce orders of finite-dimensional $F$-subspaces of
$F[t].$

Let $V$ be an $F$-vector subspace of $A=F[t]$ of dimension  $d.$ Assume that $1 \le d < \infty.$
For any $\alpha \in \bar F,$ we can choose a basis   $v_1,...., v_d$ of $V$ such that
ord$_{\alpha}(v_1)  <... < $ord$_{\alpha}(v_d).$ These numbers    ord$_{\alpha}(v_i)$ 
are independent of the choice of such a basis. 
We define   ord$_{\alpha}(V)$  by

 \centerline{ord$_{\alpha}(V) = -(d-1)d/2 +\sum_{i=1}^d  $ord$_{\alpha}(v_j).$}

Clearly,  ord$_{\alpha}(V) \ge 0.$ 
For any basis $y_1,...., y_d$ of $V$ we have

\centerline{ord$_{\alpha}(V) \ge  -(d-1)d/2 +\sum_{i=1}^d  $ord$_{\alpha}(y_i).$}

This is because by addition operations with  the polynomials  $y_j$
we can make all ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$ distinct while increasing them
or keeping them the same. To get a better bound, we can replace one of
$y_j$ with minimal ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$     
by  $y_0=y_1+\cdots+y_d.$ This proves
a  more precise inequality: 

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Lemma 3.2.} {\it Let  $V$ be as above and  $y_1,...., y_d$ a basis of $V$ over $F.$
Then, for all  $\alpha \in \bar F,$}

ord$_{\alpha}(V)  \ge  -\Delta($ord$_{\alpha}(y_1),..., $ord$_{\alpha}(y_d)) + \sum_{j=1}^d $ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$

\noindent $and$

ord$_{\alpha}(V)  \ge  -\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_d) + \sum_{j=1}^d    $ord$_{\alpha}(y_j) - \min($ord$_{\alpha}(y_0),..., $ord$_{\alpha}(y_d)).$
\smallskip


   Also we can choose a basis $v_1,...., v_d$ of $V$ such that
deg$(v_1) <...< $ deg$(v_d).$  The numbers  deg$(v_i)$
are independent of the choice of such a basis. 
We set
$$\deg(V) = -d(d-1)/2 +\sum_{i=1}^d  \deg(v_i)$$
and
$$ {\rm ord}_{\infty}(V) = -d(d-1)/2 +\sum_{i=1}^d  {\rm ord}_{\infty}(v_i),$$
 where  ord$_{\infty}(v_i) = -\deg(v_i).$

Clearly, deg$(V) \ge 0$  and   deg$(V) + $ord$_{\infty}(V) = -d(d-1).$
For any basis $v_1,...., v_d$ of $V$ we have
  deg$(V) \le -d(d-1)/2 +\sum_{i=1}^d   \deg(v_i).$ Moreover, we
have the following analogue of Lemma 3.2:

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Lemma 3.3.} {\it The conclusions of  Lemma $3.2$ also hold  for $\alpha = \infty.$}
\smallskip
\noindent {\it Proof.} It is similar to that of Lemma 3.2. Also Lemma 3.3 can be reduced to Lemma 3.2 by a change of variable.
\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Proposition 3.4. }  deg$(V) =  \sum_{\alpha \in \bar F}  $ord$_{\alpha}(V).$
\smallskip

\noindent {\it Proof.} We pick a basis   $v_1,...., v_d$ of $V$ and consider the Wronskian
$D =$ det$(v_i^{(j)}).$
It is a nonzero polynomial in $F[t],$ and it is determined by $V$  up to a nonzero scalar factor.
Choosing $v_i$ as in the definition of deg($V$), we see that
deg($D$) = deg($V$). Indeed, writing the determinant  $D$ as a sum of $d$! terms, we
see that every nonzero term has degree deg($V$) and that the sum of 
coefficients in this degree is, up to a nonzero scalar factor equal to the  product of leading terms in
$v_i,$ the determinant
of the matrix
$({k_i\choose j-1})_{1 \le i,j \le d}$
which is, up to the factor $(1!...(d-1)!)^d,$ the   Vandermonde determinant
det$(k_i^j)$ = $\prod_{i<j}  (k_i - k_j) \ne 0$ where $k_i$ = deg$(v_i).$

On the  other hand,
choosing $v_i$ as in the definition of ord$_{\alpha}(V),$
we see that ord$_{\alpha}(D$) = ord$_{\alpha}(V$) for all $\alpha \in \bar F.$ Indeed
writing the determinant  $D$ as a sum of $d$! terms, we
see that every term is divisible by  $(x - \alpha)^{{\rm ord}_{\alpha}(V)}$
and that the sum of the terms of order  ord$_{\alpha}(V$) is, up to
a factor of order 0 equal to the product of  $v_i/(x- \alpha)^{{\rm ord}_{\alpha}(v_i)},$
the determinant of  the matrix
$({k_i\choose j-1})_{1 \le i,j \le d}$
which is, up to the factor $(1!...(d-1)!)^d,$ the  Vandermonde determinant
det($k_i^j) = \prod_{i<j}  (k_i - k_j)$
where $k_i = $de$g(v_i).$

Now  deg($V$) = deg($D$) = $\prod_{\alpha \in \bar F} $ord$_{\alpha}(D) = \prod $ord$_{\alpha}(V).$ 

$Remark.$  When $d = 1,$ the proposition says that deg($D$) = $\sum_{\alpha \in \bar F} $ord$_{\alpha}(D)$  for every nonzero polynomial $D \in F[t].$

$Remark.$  As a corollary of the proposition,   $\sum _{\alpha} $ord$_{\alpha}(V) < \infty.$

\smallskip
Now we are ready to prove Theorem 3.1.
Let  $d_0 \le d_1 \le ... \le d_m$ be the degrees of $y_j  (0\le j \le m)$ written in 
nondecreasing order.
Then 
 $d_{m-1} = d_m \ge m.$
By Lemma 3.3 with $d=m$,   
$$\deg(V) = -m(m-1) - {\rm ord}_{\infty}(V) \le -m(m-1) + \Delta_{\infty}(y_1,..., y_m) -d_m + \sum_{j=0}^m d_j.$$

On the other hand, since gcd($y_1,...., y_m$) = 1,  for any  $\alpha  \in \bar F$
 we have  
\smallskip

\centerline{$ \min($ord$_{\alpha}(y_1),..., $ord$_{\alpha}(y_m)) = 0$}
\smallskip

\noindent  and, by Lemma 3.2 with $d=m,$

 $${\rm ord}_{\alpha}(V) \ge  -\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_m) + \sum_{j=1}^m {\rm ord}_{\alpha}(y_j).$$

Switching, if neccessary,  $-y_0$ with a polynomial  $y_j$ such that $y_j(\alpha) \ne 0,$
we have

$${\rm ord}_{\alpha}(V) \ge  -\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_m) + \sum_{j=0}^m {\rm ord}_{\alpha}(y_j).$$

Taking the sum over all   $\alpha  \in \bar F$
and    using Proposition 3.1 and the fact that 
 deg$(y_j) = \sum $ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$  for each $j,$ we obtain

deg($V) =  \sum _{\alpha  \in \bar F} $ord$_{\alpha}(V) \ge
- \sum _{\alpha  \in \bar F} \Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_m) + \sum_{j=0}^m d_j.$

Comparing these upper and lower bounds for  deg($V$) and cancelling 
$ \sum_{j=0}^m d_j$, we obtain the conclusion of Theorem 3.1.
\smallskip

Here are some  consequences of Theorem 3.1.

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Corollary 3.5} (cf. Theorem on p.480 of [NS]). {\it Let $n \ge 3$ and 
$ \sum_{j=1}^m x_j^n = t$
in $F[t]$ with} char($F$) = 0. {\it Then $m^2 - m > n.$}
\smallskip

\noindent {\it Proof.}  Without loss of generality, we can assume that $F$ is algebraically
closed and
that  $x_1^n,..., x_m^n$  are linearly independent (otherwise,  $t$ is a sum of a smaller number of $n$-th powers).
  Also gcd($x_1^n,...,x_m^n)
=1$  because this is an $n$-th power dividing  $t$ and $n \ge 2.$
Let  $M =  \max(\deg(x_1),..., \deg(x_m)).$
By  Theorem 3.1,
$$Mn \le -(m-1)m/2 + (m-1)(\nu(t)+\sum_{j=1}^m\nu(x_j))$$
$$\le -(m-1)m/2  + (m-1)(1+Mm)  < Mm(m-1),$$
 because $\nu(y_j)=\nu(x_j) \le \deg(x_j) \le M, \nu(t) = 1,$ and
 $m \ge 3$   when  $n \ge 3.$ 

$Remark.$ The condition  $n \ge 3$ is necessary, and it is implicit in the
theorem on p.480 of [NS], see p.479 or 481 in [NS].

\noindent {\bf Corollary 3.6.}  {\it Let  $n \ge 2$ and 
$ \sum_{j=1}^m x_j^n = tx_0^n$   
in $F[t]$ with $x_0 \ne 0$ and}  char($F$) = 0. {\it Then $m^2  > n +1.$}
\smallskip

\noindent {\it Proof.}
 Without loss of generality, we can assume
 that $F$ is algebraically
closed,
that  $x_1^n,..., x_m^n$  are linearly independent,
 and that gcd($x_1,..., x_m) = 1.$
Let  
$$M =  \max(\deg(x_1),..., \deg(x_m)).$$
By  Theorem 3.1,
$Mn <  (M(m +1 +1))(m-1)-m(m-1)/2,$ hence  $n < m^2 -1$ when $n \ge 3.$ When $n=2,$ notice that $m \ge 2.$

$Remark.$ This improves upon the theorem on p.483 of [NS] which asserts that 
$m^2 > n/8.$

\smallskip
Theorem 3.7. {\it Let $n \ge 2$ and  $x_1^n+\cdots+x_m^n = x_0$ in $F[t]$ with char($F$) = 0.

 Then  }
 $$\deg(x_0) \ge M(n - m^2 +m) + (m-1)m/2,$$
 {\it where } $M :=  \max(\deg(x_1),..., \deg(x_m)).$
\smallskip

	\noindent {\it Proof.}  Without loss of generality, we can assume that $F$ is algebraically
closed, that $m \ge 2$ (the case $m =1$ is trivial), that  gcd($x_1,..., x_m$) = 1 (the general case follows easily from the primitive one), that $n >  m(m-1)/2$ (otherwise there is nothing to prove),  that   $x_1^n,..., x_m^n$ are linearly independent over $F$ (otherwise the number $m$ can be reduced), and that   	$M$ = deg($x_m$).  
Using Theorem 3.1
with $y_0= -x_m^n,  y_m=-x_0, y_j = x_j^n$ for $j \le m-1$
and the fact that  

$\Delta_{\alpha}(y_1,..., y_m) \le
(m-1)(\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} $sign(ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)) + $ord$_{\alpha}(y_m)$

\noindent for all $\alpha \in \bar F,$  we obtain that
$$nM = \deg(y_0)  \le  \deg(x_0) + \sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \nu(y_j) -m(m-1)/2$$
$$\le  \deg(x_0) + (m-1)mM  -m(m-1)/2,$$
 hence
   deg$(x_0) \ge M(n - m^2+m) +  m(m-1)/2.$
 
$Remark.$
Our theorem is close to the theorem on p.481
of [NS] and has the same conclusion as the second conclusion of that theorem.
 The condition that $n \ge 2$ is implicit in [NS] (without this condition
the theorem is not true).
We relaxed the condition of [NS] that all $x_j$  are nonconstant and nonlinear to the
condition that not all of them are constant. 
We imposed an additional condition that 
 $x_1^n,..., x_m^n$ are linearly independent over $F$
to prevent   counterexamples to the theorem of [MS] like the following two:

(i) $m = 2$, any $n \ge  2$, any $M \ge  1, x_1= t^M, x_2= -t^M, x_0 = 0;$

(ii) $m = 2,$ any $n \ge  3$, any $M \ge  1, x_1= t^M, x_2= t^M, x_0 = 2t^M.$

The condition is missing in [NS] by mistake. When  $F = \bar F,$ this condition is weaker than the condition that $x_0$ is not a sum of a smaller than $m$ number of
$n$-th powers in $F[t].$  It could also be  replaced by the condition that  $x_0$ is not divisible by any nonconstant $n$-th power in $F[t].$

The first conclusion of the theorem of [NS] is that
 deg($x_0) \ge n - (m-1)m/2. $ However, this conclusion 
 is stated twice on the same page as deg($x_0) \ge n - (m-1)m,$
which follows from our theorem because either $M=0$ and $m=1$ or $M \ge 1.$
Also the theorem implies that deg($x_0) \ge n - (m-1)m$ when  either $n \ge m^2-m$  or  $M=1.$ By the way, when $M=1$ it is easy to prove that in fact
deg($x_0) \ge n -m +1,$ and that this bound cannot be improved when 
$n \ge m-1$ and $F = \bar F.$

\smallskip
Theorem 2.2(a) with linearly independent $y_1,...,y_m$ (which we have obtained from Theorem 3.1)
  allows us  now to obtain Theorem 1.3 in the following two cases (in general,
Theorem 1.3 follows from Theorem 2.2  which we will obtain from Theorem 4.4 below).

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Corollary 3.8.} {\it The equation  $(1.1)$ has no nonconstant  indecomposable primitive
solutions when $ n \ge m^2-1.$}
\smallskip

\noindent {\it Proof.} Consider  such a solution of  (1.1). 
Let $M=\max(\deg(x_1),...,\deg(x_m)).$ If  $x_1^n,..., x_m^n$ are linearly independent,
then Theorem 3.1 via Theorem 2.2 (a) gives that
$Mn <  (m+1)M(m-1).$

If  $x_1^n,..., x_m^n$ are linearly dependent, we consider a linear relation of minimal length.  Permuting terms, we can assume that
this relation is $c_1x_1^n+\cdots +c_{d+1}x_{d+1}^n = 0.$ If not all
terms here are colinear, we divide this equality by the gcd and pass
  to  $\bar F$  to conclude that   $n < d^2 -1 < m^2 -1.$
Otherwise, we also pass to  $\bar F$  and replace all terms by one term
of the form $x'^n$ and after dividing by the gcd we obtain an equation of
the form  (1.1) with not all terms constant and  with the same $n$ but $m$ replaced by  $m -d < m,$ hence we are done by induction on $m.$

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Corollary 3.9.} {\it The equation  $(1.2$) has no nonconstant indecomposable
solutions with pairwise coprime terms when $\sum 1/n_j \le 1(m-1).$}
\smallskip

\noindent {\it Proof.} Again  either the terms are linearly independent and we are done
by Theorem 3.1 or we can obtain a shorter equation of the same form
form (passing, if necessary, to   $\bar F).$  Here we cannot divide
by the gcd because this produces nonconstant coefficients, but we do not
need to do this because the terms are pairwise coprime.

  
  \bigskip
\centerline  {\bf 4 IMPROVING  THEOREM 2.2 IN GENERAL}
 \medskip

 Now we drop the condition about linear independence and
prove a  more  precise version of  Theorem  2.2
involving the dimension $d \le m$ of  $Fy_1+\cdots+ F y_m$ and another number
$d' \le d$ which is defined below.   

First we introduce two definitions which make sense for any
sequence (family, multiset)   $y_0,...,y_m$ of vectors in an $F$-vector space.
Following [BM], a nonempty subset  $I \subset \{0,1,...,m\}$ is called
$minimal$  if the corresponding family  $\{y_j : j \in I\}$ of
vectors is linearly dependent
over $F$ but   $\{y_j : j \in J\}$ is linearly independent
over $F$ for any proper subset $J \subset I.$  A linear relation is called
$minimal$  if the corresponding family of vectors is minimal.

Clearly, card($I) \le d+1$ for any minimal set  $I$. We define $d'+1$  to be the   maximal cardinality of the minimal sets.
  Thus,     $d' \le d = $ dim$(Fy_0+\cdots+Fy_m).$

In general not every index $j$  needs   to be an element of a minimal set.  The condition $y_0 = y_1+\cdots+y_m$ in Theorem  2.2
implies that every $j$ is contained in a minimal set. Namely, we can take a basis not involving  $j$,   write  $y_j$ with respect to this basis, and drop
zero terms to obtain such a set.
This condition,
together with the condition of
no vanishing subsums of Theorems 2.2 and 4.1, implies that all linear
relations between  $y_0,y_1,..., y_m$ follow from minimal relations
 (Lemma 4 of [BM]).

We call a family (multiset)   $y_0,...,y_m$ of vectors $irreducible$ if for any  partition 
$I\cup I' = \{0,1,...,m\}$ into nonempty parts,  the corresponding vector
subspaces   $\sum_{j \in I} Fy_j$ and $\sum_{j \in I'} Fy_j$ have
a nonzero intersection. For example, every minimal set gives an irreducible
family of vectors. Under the conditions of Theorem 2.2, the family
$y_0,...,y_m$ is irreducible. It can be shown that
for every irreducible family     $z_0,...,z_m$ of vectors there are nonzero
$c_j \in F$ such that  $y_j= c_jz_j$ satisfy the conditions of Theorem 2.2.
So the conditions of the next two theorems are not really more general than
those of Theorem 2.2 (but the conclusions are stronger).

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Theorem 4.1. } {\it Let  $m \ge 2,    y_j \in F[t],
\gcd(y_1,..., y_m) = 1,$ and  $y_0,y_1,...,y_m $    be  an  irreducible family.
  Let  $ d$   be the dimension  of  $Fy_1+\cdots+Fy_m$   over   $F$    and  let   $d' \le d$    be as  above. 
 Then: }

(a) deg($y_0) \le     (\nu(y_0...y_m) -1)(d'-1)d/2.$

 {\it Furthermore, if    $\deg(y_1) =...= \deg(y_m),$   then: }

(b) deg($y_0) \le     (\nu(y_0...y_m) -2)(d'-1)d/2.$
\smallskip

\noindent {\it Proof.}  First we consider the special case when  $d=m.$
Since  the family  $y_0,y_1,...,y_m $ is irreducible, $d'=d=m$ 
and 
$y_0 = \sum_{j=1}^m  c_jy_j $  with  $0 \ne c_j \in F.$ Applying Theorem 3.1, 
we obtain that

deg$(y_0) \le \deg(y_m) \le
 -(m-1)m +\sum_{\alpha \in  P^1(\bar F)} \Delta_{\alpha}(c_1y_1,..., c_my_m).$

Now we use that  $\Delta_{\alpha}(c_1y_1,..., c_my_m) \le (m-1)m/2$
for all  $\alpha \in  P^1(\bar F)$ and that in the case
$\deg(y_1) =\cdots  = \deg(y_m)$ we have
$$\Delta_{\infty}(c_1y_1,..., c_my_m) =\min(\deg(y_m)- \deg(y_0), m-1) 
\le \deg(y_m)- \deg(y_0)$$
 to obtain  the theorem.

 Now we consider the  general  case. Note that  $y_j \ne 0$ for all $j$s because 
of the irreducibility condition.
 We proceed by induction on  $m.$ If $m=2,$ then either
$d=2$ and we are done by the special case above or  $d=1$ and all $y_j$ are constants,
so both our  conclusions say that  $0 \le 0$ which is true. Assume now that  $d < m \ge 3.$

   
By the irreducibility condition, we can write  $y_0$ as a linear combination of
$y_1,..., y_m.$  Dropping $j$s with zero coefficients, we obtain a 
 minimal $I_0 \subset \{0,1,...,m\}$  containing 0 with $2 \le$ card($I_0) \le d'+1 \le d+1 \le m.$
The corresponding family   $\{y_j': j \in I_0\}$   is an irreducible family.
 Let 
$\{y_j: j \in I_1\}$ be an irreducible  family  containing $I_0$ and with maximal possible
card($I_1) \le m.$ Set  $m'  =$ card($I_1)-1,  V_1=\sum_{j \in I_1} Fy_j,
  d_1 = \dim(V_1),$ and $z_1 = \gcd(V_1).$

 By the induction hypothesis, 
$$\eqalign   {\deg(y_0/z_1) &\le  (\nu(\prod_{j \in I_1}  (y_j/z_1) -e)d_1(d'-1)/2 \cr
&\le    (\nu (y_0y_1...y_m)   -e)d_1(d'-1)/2}  \eqno (4.2) $$
 where  $e= 2$ when   deg$(y_1) =...= \deg(y_m),$ and $e=1$ otherwise.

When $z_1 =1,$ e.g., $d'=d,$ we are done.  In general, we need an upper bound for
deg($z_1$) to finish the proof.
      Let $I_2$ be the complement of $I_1$ in  $\{0,1,...,m\}$ and
$ V_2=\sum_{j \in I_2} Fy_j.$
By the irreducibility condition, $V_1 \cap V_2 \ne 0.$

Let $0 \ne z = \sum_{j \in I'} c_jy_j  \in    V_1 \cap V_2$  be a vector with the least number of
nonzero coefficients when written as
   a linear combination of  $\{y_j: j \in I_2\}$
with  minimal possible number card($I'$) of nonzero coefficients, where $I' \subset I_2$  and  $c_j \in F.$ This relation is minimal,
hence  $I_1 \cup I'$ is irreducible.
By the maximality of $I_1,$ we have $I' = I_2.$
Thus, $m_2:= $ card$(I_2) = $ dim$(I_2) = d - d_1 = m - m_1 \le d'.$ 
Set $z_2= $ gcd$(V_2).$
Note that gcd($z_1,z_2) = 1.$

Applying Theorem 3.1, 
we obtain that
$$ \eqalign {  \deg(z_1) &\le \deg(z/z_2) \le \max(\deg(y_j/z_2): j \in I_2)  \cr &\le  -(m_2-1)m_2 +\sum_{\alpha \in  P^1(\bar F)} \Delta_{\alpha}(c_jy_j/z_2: j \in I_2).} \eqno (4.3) $$

Now we use different upper bounds for 
$$\Delta_{\alpha}(c_jy_j/z_2: j \in I_2)= \Delta_{\alpha}(c_jy_j: j \in I_2 )$$

\noindent in (4.3) for different  $\alpha \in  P^1(\bar F).$ When $\alpha$ is not a zero
of $(z/z_2)y_0...y_m$ nor $\alpha = \infty,$ we have
$\Delta_{\alpha}(c_jy_j: j \in I_2)  =0.$

When  $\alpha$ is   a zero
of $y_0...y_m$, we use that

  $$\Delta_{\alpha}(c_jy_j: j \in I_2) \le (m_2-1)m_2/2 \le (d-d_1)(d'-1)/2.$$
 We use the same bound when  $\alpha = \infty,$ unless
deg$(y_1) =...=  $ deg$(y_m)$ in which case we use the following more precise bound:

\smallskip
$\Delta_{\infty}(c_jy_j: j \in I_2)  =  $ min$(m_2-1, $ max(deg$(y_j):j \in I_2)- \deg(z/z_2)) $

$\le   $ max(deg$(y_j):j \in I_2)- $ deg$(z_1).$
\smallskip

Finally, 
when $\alpha$ is   a zero
of  $z/z_2$ but not a zero  of $y_0...y_m$, we use that 

 $ \Delta_{\alpha}(c_jy_j: j \in I_2) \le $ ord$_{\alpha}(z/z_2)
=   $ ord$_{\alpha}(z)- $ ord$_{\alpha}(z_1).$

Substituting these bounds to (4.3), we obtain that

 deg($z_1)  \le \deg(z/z_2) \le (\nu (y_0...y_m) -e) (d-d_1)(d'-1)/2.$

Adding this to (4.2), we obtain the conclusions of the theorem.

$Remark.$ Our Theorem 4.1(a)   improves the main result of  [Z], (see (4) on page 88 there) with $g = 0.$    The number $\mu$  in [Z] is our $d,$
and we replaced $\mu(\mu-1)/2$ in the upper bound of [Z] by  $d'(d-1)/2 \le d(d-1)/2.$  The number $S$ in [Z] is
our $\nu(y_0...y_m) +1$ when $S \ne 0;$ when  $S=0$ all terms are constant
and    $\nu(y_0...y_m) =0.$  Our Theorem 4.1(b) shows that $S$ in [Z] can
be replaced by  $S-1$ in the case when all degrees are the same. Our
proof followed those of [BM] and [Z].
% but it gives more details than [BM] and is shorter than the proof in [Z].

We neither stated nor proved extensions of our results to the case of
arbitrary genus $g$ although there are no difficulties in doing this. The number
$S$ in [BM], [Z]  can be replaced by the number  $S' \le S$ of places where not
all ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$ are the same. 

\smallskip

Our next result is similar to Theorem B of [BM] (in the case $g =0$). For any
nonzero polynomials  $y_0,..., y_m \in F[t]$ and any
$\alpha \in P^1(\bar F)$ let  $\mu(\alpha)+1$ be the number of $j$s with
minimal value of ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$ (over $0 \le j \le m).$ Note
that $1 \le \mu(\alpha) \le m.$ When  $m \ge 1$  and either  $y_0 = y_1+\cdots+y_m$   or a family  $y_0,...,y_m$ is irreducible, we have
$1 \le \mu(\alpha) $ for all $\alpha.$  When gcd($y_0,...,y_m)=1,$ the minimal value is 0
for all  $\alpha \in \bar F.$ For $\alpha = \infty, \mu(\infty)$ is the number of $j$s with maximal deg($y_j).$

\smallskip
\noindent {\bf Theorem 4.4.}
{\it Let  $m \ge 2,    y_j \in F[t],
\gcd(y_1,..., y_m) = 1,$ and  $y_0,y_1,...,y_m $    be  an  irreducible family.
  Let  $ d$   be the dimension  of  $Fy_1+\cdots+Fy_m$   over   $F$    and  let   $d' \le d$    be as  above (i.e., $d' + 1$ is the maximal cardinality of the minimal sets). Then

  $\deg(y_0) \le (d'-1) \sum_{j=0}^m \nu(y_j).$

If either $d= m$ or the index $0$ belongs to a minimal set $I_0$ with
{\rm card}($I_0) = d',$ then
 $\deg(y_0) \le -d'(d'-1)/2+ (d'-1) \sum_{j=0}^m \nu(y_j).$}
\smallskip

\noindent {\it Proof.} We follow closely the proof of Theorem 4.1.

  $Case \ 1: d=m.$ In this case
  $d'=d=m$  and  $y_0 = \sum_{j=1}^m  c_jy_j $  with  $0 \ne c_j \in F.$ 
So our statement follows from Theorem 3.1 because
 
 $ \Delta_{\alpha}(c_1y_1,..., c_my_m) \le m(m-1)/2$  for    $\alpha = \infty$ and 

$ \Delta_{\alpha}(c_1y_1,..., c_my_m) \le  (m-1) \sum_{j=0}^m  $ sign(ord$_{\alpha}(y_j))$   

\noindent for all  $ \alpha \in \bar F.$

 $ Case \ 2$: the index 0 belongs to a minimal set $I_0$ with
card($I_0) = d'.$ 

 We proceed by induction on  $m.$ If $m=2,$ then either
$d=2$ and we are done by Case 1 or  $d=1$ and all $y_j$ are constants,
so our conclusion is that    $0 \le 0.$ Assume now that  $d < m \ge 3.$

Let   $I_0, I_1, I_2, d_1,m_1, z, z_1, z_2, m_2$  be as in the proof of Theorem 4.1 with the following additional condition: we choose  $I_0 \ni 0$ with card($I_0) = d',$
so  card($I_1) \ge d'.$

 By the induction hypothesis, 
$$   \deg(y_0/z_1) \le -(d'-1)d'/2 +
  (d'-1) \sum_{j\in I_1} \nu(y_j/z_1).\eqno (4.5) $$
If  $z_1=1$, we are done because the right hand side in (4.5) is less than the right hand side in the conclusion of Theorem 4.4. 
Let now  $z_1 \ne 1.$ Then  $d' \ge d_2  \ge 2.$  We set $I_3 = I_2 \cup \{m+1\}$ and  $y_{m+1} = z.$
Applying Theorem 3.1, 
we obtain that
$$ \deg(z_1) \le \deg(z/z_2) \le  d_2\sum_{j \in I_3}\nu(y_j/z_2)
\le (d'-1)\nu(z/z_2) +  (d'-1)\sum_{j \in I_2} \nu(y_j).\eqno (4.6) $$

 Now  it remains to add (4.5) and (4.6) and to observe that    $\nu(z/z_2) \le \nu(z_1)$ and

 $\sum_{j\in I_1} \nu(y_j/z_1)  + \nu(z_1) \le \sum_{j\in I_1} \nu(y_j).$
 
 {\it General  case.}
Set  $M$ = max(deg($y_1)$,..., deg($y_m))$. We pick a $\beta \in \bar F$  which is not a zero of  $y_o...y_m$ and   replace $ y_j = y_j(t) \in  F[t]$ by 
   $z_j = t^My(1/t +\beta).$ 
Note that the family
$z_0,z_1,..., z_m \in F[t]$ is irreducible, gcd($z_1,..., z_m)=1,$ 
 deg($z_j) = M$ for all $j, \nu(y_j) = \nu(z_j)$ for at least two $j$s, and
$\nu(y_j) \le  \nu(z_j) \le \nu(y_j) +1$ for all $j.$


Now we can use Case 2  with $y_j$ replaced by $z_j$ and obtain that

 $\deg(y_0) \le M 
= \deg(z_0)    \le  m-2-d'(d'-1)/2+ (d'-1) \sum_{j=0}^m \nu(z_j) $

$= m-2-d'(d'-1)/2+ (d'-1) \sum_{j=0}^m \nu(y_j).$

If $m-2-d'(d'-1)/2 \le 0,$ we are done. Otherwise we replace
$z_j = z_j(t)$  by   $z_j(t^N)$ with a large integer $N$ and obtain that
$MN \le  m-2-d'(d'-1)/2+ M(d'-1) \sum_{j=0}^m \nu(y_j).$

Dividing   both sides by $N$ and sending $N$ to $\infty,$ we obtain the conclusion of the theorem.

 \smallskip
\noindent {\bf Corollary 4.7.}  {\it Under the conditions of Theorem $4.1, $

\noindent $\deg(y_0) \le  (d-1)\sum_{j=0}^m \nu (y_j).$

If not all
$y_j$ are constant, then

\noindent $\deg(y_0) <  (m-1)\sum_{j=0}^m \nu (y_j).$

If not all
$y_j$ are constant and they are pairwise coprime, then

\noindent  $\deg(y_0) < (d'-1)\sum_{j=0}^m \nu (y_j).$}


\noindent {\it Proof.} This follows from Theorem 4.1 using the following observations.
If all $y_j$  are constant, i.e., $d=1,$ then
the conclusion is that  $0 \le 0.$  When $y_j$ are constant and they are pairwise coprime we can apply Theorem 3.1  or Theorem 4.1   to a minimal set containing the index 0.

Our next result is similar to Theorem B of [BM] (in the case $g=0$). For any
nonzero polynomials  $y_0,..., y_m \in F[t]$ and any
$\alpha \in P^1(\bar F)$ let  $\mu(\alpha)+1$ be the number of $j$s with
minimal value of ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$ (over $0 \le j \le m).$ Note
that $1 \le \mu(\alpha) \le m.$ When  $m \ge 1$  and either  $y_0 = y_1+\cdots+y_m$   or a family  $y_0,...,y_m$ is irreducible, we have
$1 \le \mu(\alpha) $ for all $\alpha.$  When gcd($y_0,...,y_m)=1,$ the minimal value is 0
for all  $\alpha \in \bar F.$ For $\alpha = \infty, \mu(\infty)$ is the number of $j$s with maximal deg($y_j).$

\centerline  {\bf 5 NONZERO CHARACTERISTIC CASE}
\medskip

Now let  $p=$ char$(F) \ne 0.$ It was shown in [P, p.54]  that
the equation
$$ x_1^n + x_2^n = x_3^n + x_4^n \eqno (5.1) $$ 
 has nontrivial solutions for every $n.$
When $n$ is odd or $F$ is algebraically closed, (5.1) is essentially the same equation as (1.1) with $m = 3.$

 
In [V2] it is shown that for every $n,$ every polynomial in $F[t]$ is the sum of
at most $n_{(p)}$  $n$-th  powers 
provided that $F$ is  an algebraically closed field  with char$(F) = p \ne 0$  and $n$ is coprime with $p.$ Here $n_{(p)} = \prod(a_i + 1) - 1 \le n,$ where the $a_i$ are the digits of $n$ in base $p.$  
Moreover [V2] gives solutions with pairwise
coprime $x_i.$
 It follows that  (1.1) has nontrivial solutions
(with an arbitrary $x_{0}$)
when  $m \ge  S(n,p),$
where  $S(n,p)$ is the minimum of $(nk)_{(p)}$ over all natural numbers $k.$
Obviously,  $S(n,p)$ could be small for very large $n.$ For example,  $S(n, p) =3$ if $n>2$  divides $p^k +1$ for some  $k.$ So for  all such $n$ and any
$x_0$, the equation  (1.1) with $m=3$ has nontrivial solutions in $\bar F[t],$
 where $\bar F$ is an algebraic closure of $F.$
 
 
Thus, when $p \ne 0,$ no upper bound on  $m$ prevents the existence of indecomposable primitive nonconstant solutions of  (1.1) in  $F[t],$ and one cannot
place any    bound of the form  $m < f(n)$ with $f(n) \rightarrow \infty$ 
as $n \rightarrow \infty$ 
 to prevent pairwise  coprime
nonconstant solutions. One can hope to obtain  a bound of the
form  $n < f(S(n,p))$  (under additional conditions on solutions).

  
 The main trouble is that
the determinant  $D$ in Section 3 may vanish even when  $y_1,...,y_m $ are linearly independent over
$F.$ In fact [K] it vanishes if and only if $y_1,...,y_m $  are  linearly dependent over $F(t^p).$  If $D \ne 0,$ then it is easy to obtain   
 much sharper conclusions (cf. the case $k=1$ of the next proposition).

For any integer $k \ge 1,$ we set  $F_k = F(t^{p^k}).$
For any natural number  $n= \sum s_ip^i$ written in base $p,$   we set
   mod$(m,p^k) =
\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} s_ip^i.$
     For any nonzero polynomial  $z=z(t) = c\prod (t-\alpha)^{n(\alpha)}
\in F[t],$  where  $0 \ne c \in F, \alpha \in \bar F, n(\alpha) = $ ord$_{\alpha}(z),$ and any integer $k \ge 1,$
we define  deg$_k(z) = \sum_{\alpha} $ mod$(n(\alpha),p^k).$
It is a nondecreasing function of $k$ and deg$_k(z) =$ deg$(z)$  when $p^k \ge $ deg$(z).$ 
We denote by  $\nu_k(z)$ the number of exponents  $n(\alpha)$ which are not divisible by $p^k.$ In particular,  $\nu(z) = \nu_1(z).$

\smallskip  
\noindent {\bf Proposition 5.2.} {\it Let $m \ge 2$   and  $y_0 = y_1+\cdots+ y_m $ with    $y_j \in F[t].$ Suppose that    $\gcd(y_0,...,y_m)=1.$ For some integer $k \ge 1$
assume that
  $y_1,...,y_m$ are linearly independent over
$F_k.$  
Then

$\deg(y_0) \le  -m(m-1)/2+ \sum_{j=0}^m \deg_k(y_j)
\le  -m(m-1)/2+ (p^k-1)\sum_{j=0}^m \nu_k(y_j).$

Moreover, in the case $k=1,$

$\deg(y_0) \le  -m(m-1)/2+ (m-1)\sum_{j=0}^m\nu(y_j).$}


\smallskip

\noindent {\it Proof.}  
 The condition of linear independence implies that
$p^k \ge m.$ We write  $y_j=y_j(t) = \sum_{s=0}^{p^k-1}  y_{j,s}(t)^{p^k} t^s$
with  $y_{j,s}(t) = y_{j,s}  \in F[t].$ Such a representation is unique
which is easy to see by induction on $k.$ Also by induction on $k$ it is easy to see that

ord$_{\alpha}(y_{j,s}) \ge ($ord$_{\alpha}(y_j) - $mod(ord$_{\alpha}(y_j),p^k))/p^k$

\noindent for all $\alpha,j, s.$ Now we consider the matrix
$(y_{j,s})_{1\le j \le m, 0 \le s \le p^k-1}.$ Its rank is $m.$ We choose a square $m$ by $m$ submatrix with nonzero determinant  $D_0 \in F[t].$
Since  $p^k\deg(y_{j,s}) +s  \le $ deg$(y_j),$ we have
deg$(y_{j,s}) \le $ (deg$(y_j)-s)/p^k$ and 

deg($D_0)  \le (-m(m-1)/2 +\sum_{j=1}^m  $ deg$(y_j))/p^k.$   
 
On the other hand, 

ord$_{\alpha}(D_0) \ge \sum_{j=0}^m $(ord$_{\alpha}(y_j) - $mod(ord$_{\alpha}(y_j),p^k))/p^k$ 

\noindent for every $\alpha \in \bar F$  which is not a zero of  $y_0.$
Moreover this inequality also holds for every $\alpha \in \bar F$ which is
a zero of $y_0,$ because  $D_0 = D_j,$  where $D_j$ is the determinant
of the matrix obtained by replacing   $y_{j,s}$ by $y_{0,s},$ and $0 \ne
c_j \in  F[t^{p^l}] \subset  F[t^{p^k}]$ for all $j.$

  Thus,

$\sum_{j=0}^m $ (deg$(y_j)- $ deg$_k(y_j))/p^k =
 \sum_{j=0}^m \sum_{\alpha \in \bar F}  $(ord$_{\alpha}(y_j) - $mod(ord$_{\alpha}(y_j),p^k))/p^k$
     
$\le  \sum_{\alpha \in \bar F} $ ord$_{\alpha}D_0    =$ deg$(D_0) 
\le    (-m(m-1)/2 +\sum_{j=1}^m  $ deg$(y_j))/p^k,$

\noindent hence  we obtain the first conclusion.

Now we consider the case $k = 1.$ Note that the linear independence implies that $m \le p$
 and that the Wronskian
$D_0 =$ det$(y_j^{(i)})_{0 \le j \le m, 1 \le i \le m-1} \ne 0.$
It is clear that the row $j$ is divisible by  $(t - \alpha)^n$
with 

$n=$ ord$_{\alpha}(y_j) -$ (the last digit of  ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)$  in base $p)  \le $ ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)- p+1 $

$\le $ ord$_{\alpha}(y_j)- m+1.$

\noindent Since $c_0D_0=c_jD_j,$ where $D_j$ is the determinant obtained  when we replace   $y_j$ by $y_0,$ it follows that  

deg$(D_0) \ge  - (m-1)\nu(y_j) + \sum_{j=0}^m  $ deg$(y_j).$

On the other hand,

deg$(D_0) \le  -m(m-1)/2+  \sum_{j=1}^m $ deg$(y_j).$

\noindent Comparing this upper bound for deg$(D_0)$ with the above lower bound
and taking into account that  deg$(y_j) =$ deg$_l(y_j),$
we obtain the conclusion.

$Remarks.$ We do not pursue in this paper improvements  of the proposition  similar to Theorem 3.1. 

We could prove the proposition using divided derivatives (cf. [GV], [Wa]).

  If  $y_1,...., y_m$ are linearly independent over $F$ then 
they are  linearly independent over $F_k$ for all sufficiently large $k.$
However  the proposition gives a meaningful  upper bound on deg($y_0)$ only when
 $k$ is small.

 The proposition can be easily  generalized to the situation when
every linearly independent over $F$ subsequence in  $y_1,...,y_m$ stays
linearly independent over $F_k.$  This is always true for sufficiently large
$k,$ but the larger the $k$ the weaker the conclusion.

 MANUSCRIPT PREPARATION

    Formats
    Journal contributors should model articles after the published articles in the journal to which they are submitting and may contact the Editor for
    additional information. 

    Word Processing
    The preferred format for submitted manuscript is Microsoft Word for the PC. Submitting your manuscript in this format ensures it will be handled in the
    most efficient manner. If you do not have access to this particular word processing program, or to a PC, please save your document as Rich Text Format
    (RTF). RTF is available through the "Save As" option on most major word processing packages.

    Please refer to the sections below titled Math and Chemical Structures for instructions on how to prepare manuscript containing these elements.

    Use one typeface and size, even for the title of your article and headings (12-point Times Roman is good). For italicized text, you may either underscore
    or use the italic font (be consistent in your choice). Do not use formatting (bold, italic and underline) to indicate article title and headings. Emphasis may
    appear in these elements where appropriate (e.g., scientific names, etc.). Do not include any commands for page breaks or headers or footers. Do not use
    an automatic numbering function to create numbered lists since the numbers may be lost when translated to typesetting software. 

    File Names
    Assign descriptive names to your files, e.g., TEXT, REFERENCES, OUTLINE, TABLE1, FIGURE1, FIG1_CHEM1, etc. Please use separate files for the
    body of your article, references, outline and figures. Macintosh users, please append ".doc" to the end of Word filenames and ".xls" to the end of Excel
    filenames.

    Title of Your Article and Headings 
    Use the same typeface and size as your text. Do not boldface, underscore or italicize your article title or headings. Place them flush left (not centered or
    indented). Insert a double return (or double "Enter") above and below all headings. 
    Title Style:
            ALL CAPITAL LETTERS (chemical prefixes and elemental symbols may include lowercase letters)
    First-Level Headings Style:
            ALL CAPITAL LETTERS
    Second-Level:
            Initial Capital and Then Lowercase Letters for Each Main Word
    Third-Level:
            Capital letter for the first word only; all lowercase letters thereafter


    Article Outline
    Please submit both electronic and print copies of your article outline. The outline should include all section headings, as they appear in your article. Please
    make the relationships between section headings obvious. The outline will be used in the production process to mark, tag, and check the subordination
    (levels) of the section headings.

    No Automatic Hyphenation or Justification
    Let lines "wrap" from one to the next, inserting hard returns only at the ends of headings, paragraphs, entries in a numbered or bulleted list, and
    references. Use a hyphen only when it connects part of a word. Do not divide syllables at the end of a line. 

    Vertical Spacing
    Your hard copy printout may be marked up, so please double-space throughout (including "References" and illustration legends) to make it easy to read
    the final, edited manuscript. Double-space by using the appropriate line spacing command, not by using two returns. To indicate a required line
    ending--such as at the end of a heading, paragraph, list entry, or references--use a double return (or double "Enter"); do not indent. Do not use any
    additional vertical space beyond this. Double returns separating elements will convert into the final space you will see in typeset pages. 

    Horizontal Spacing
    Use only a single space after a period or other punctuation; do not use the old typewriter style of hitting the spacebar twice after a period. Do not indent;
    new paragraphs are to be indicated by a double return (or double "Enter"). 

    Numbers
    Be careful not to type the letter "l" for the number one, or the letter "o" for the number zero. 

    Dashes
    For a dash, use two hyphens--with no spacing before or after.

    Symbols
    If you use a symbol in one place, continue to do so throughout. Example: If you use the symbol  for multiplication, do not use the letter x later. 

    Math
    Manuscripts containing significant amounts of mathematical equations should be prepared in TeX/LaTeX. Please submit your TeX or LaTeX files either as
    plain TeX or standard LaTeX2e languages with little or no customization. The Dekker LaTeX macro and instructions for its use will soon be available upon
    request at mathguide@dekker.com. Simple math equations may be done in MathType4, if there are no suitable keyboard characters. Mathematical
    equations, regardless of language, should not be located in the middle of a paragraph; they should be keyed between paragraphs, not inside. 

  
    INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING REFERENCES
    Dekker is standardizing our reference formats for all journal articles to facilitate reference linking. (For more information on reference linking initiatives,
    please consult the CrossRef web site at www.crossref.org.) Compliance with reference format instructions will significantly reduce manuscript production
    time. We understand that some information, e.g., an issue number, may not be available. Please include as much of the specified information as possible.
    Note that there are different formats for periodicals, books, etc.; please follow the appropriate model for each type of reference. Typefaces, commas,
    semicolons, and periods will serve as identifiers to a computer program for parsing and adding XML tags to the references.

    Please cite references in the text by number only enclosed in parentheses. At the end of the article, list the references in the order they appear in the text.
    Footnotes should be included in the list of references.
