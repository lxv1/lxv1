In the movie, the prof offers a version of game where the host decides whether to offer you to change.<br>
This&nbsp; is not a one player game anymore!<br>
The student gives the "change" answer&nbsp; which is correct for the standard game (one player game).<br>
The prof&nbsp; hints him that he is wrong.<br>
The student insists.<br>
The prof agrees.<br>
<br>
This does not make any sense. Both are incompetent.<br>

<br>
In stanadrd versions,&nbsp; there are 2 players.<br>
There is exactly one Pareto optimal payoff when both payers respect Code of Silence,<br>
but this is not an equilibrium. There is exactly one equilibrium (both players do Plea Bargaining).<br>
(At the Pareto optimal payoff, the players non nrecessary&nbsp; get maximal payoffs - there are many versions.)<br>
