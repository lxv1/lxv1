Robert P. Langlands
Interview by Sunday Punch, April 10, 1983

Great minds are often confounded by common questions. Witness the struggle
of Dr. Robert P. Langlands of the Institute for Advanced Study as he confronts
the mystery of self.

Q: "What does a theoretical mathematician do?"
A; Y"ou mean what does he do or why does he do it?
Q: "What is your aim, your goal?""
A: "Let me think a minute before I answer that question.  Are you asking,
what is the purpose of of theoretical mathematics? What role does it play
in lives of mathematicians or what are individuals' motives?
Q: "What does a theoretical mathematician do all day? What is the nature of his work? What is his pursuit, his activity?"
A: All right, but of course there are many things one does. But you want to know what he does when he thinks?"
Q: "Yes, exactly."
A: "Ah, well, I 
've never been able to explain to anyone else, any non-mathematician, that to me at least the objects with which one deals are very real. But that is not precisely an answer to your question."

No, professor, not precisely.
