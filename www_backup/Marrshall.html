<p>Research of Robert Marshall relevant to potential Auction Center
<p>The bulk of my research on auctions, and procurements, has concerned
collusion by bidders. One side of the work has addressed the strategic
behavior of colluding bidders within a given auction scheme. Another side
of the work has addressed the comparative robustness of different auction
schemes to collusion. A separate small vein of the work has been dedicated
to the strategies a seller might use to combat collusion during an auction.
There is also a small part of the work that addresses the appropriate application
(from an economic perspective) of antitrust law to issues associated with
bidder collusion. The techniques employed have been theoretical, numerical,
and empirical.
<p>Note. Although there are many ``on-line'' auctions, issues associated
specifically with them are currently not part of my research program (could
be in the future).
