  Stability of a stochastic process on a cone-shaped Hamiltonian.
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of the laws of a stochastic process whose trajectories are governed by a two-dimensional weakly dissipative dynamical system with a cone-shaped Hamiltonian, with the critical point at the origin. Studying the Wasserstein $L_p$-distance as the shortest distance between these laws on the corresponding canonical probability spaces, we show that it is Markovian and non-expansive (up to a constant) in time.

  Weak convergence of stratified processes: Wasserstein distance and   Khasminskii's coordinates.
Abstract: We consider laws of the graph-valued processes whose trajectories are governed by two-dimensional weakly dissipative dynamical systems with a degenerate Hamiltonian. Using a particular Wasserstein distance as the shortest distance between the measures on the corresponding canonical probability spaces, we estimate the rate of the weak convergence of the laws of the original process to the unique law of a Markov process evolving on a stratified graph. In one of our previous papers, we have computed the distance in the related classical case, and showed that the corresponding distance in the stratified case is at least of the order of the distance in the related classical case, and at most of the order delivered by the total variation of these measures over the paths crossing the boundary of the critical set of the degenerate Hamiltonian.
In this work we investigate whether this total variation is connected with the gluing conditions. The analysis of the convergence of these measures relies on a finer set of so-called Khasminskii's coordinates used about the boundary of the critical set. Is it possible to obtain an explicit bound on the total variation of these laws using Khasminskii's coordinates? This question is likely to be connected to the previous one, and if answered positively, will reveal the role that gluing plays in this matter.
    Rate of the Weak Convergence of a Stochastic Stratified Process. Submitted.
Abstract: We consider laws of a stochastic process whose trajectories are governed by a two-dimensional weakly dissipative dynamical system with a degenerate Hamiltonian. Using Wasserstein distance as the shortest distance between the measures on the corresponding canonical probability spaces, we estimate the rate of the weak convergence of the laws of the original process to the unique law of a Markov process evolving on a stratified space. Additionally, for a related (non-stratified) example of a process on a cylinder, the corresponding estimates are obtained using two different methods. One of the methods revealed the explicit expression for the Wasserstein distance.
By presenting this work, we make the first explicit attempt to use minimal metrics to estimate the rate of convergence of stochastic stratified processes.
