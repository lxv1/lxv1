<p class="p17"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.rightwingnews.com/column-2/environmentalism-and-human-sacrifice/"><b>Environmentalism and Human Sacrifice</b></a></span>.  [There are] people who are more devoted to nature than to human life.  And who might such people be?  They are called environmentalists.  These are the people who coerced nations worldwide into banning DDT.  It is generally estimated this ban has led to the deaths of about 50 million human beings, overwhelmingly African children, from malaria.  DDT kills the mosquito that spreads malaria to human beings.  US News and World Report writer Carrie Lukas reported in 2010, "Fortunately, in September 2006, the World Health Organization announced a change in policy:  It now recommends DDT for indoor use to fight malaria.</p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/9884790/Mosquito-repellent-Deet-losing-its-effectiveness.html"><b>Mosquito repellent Deet 'losing its effectiveness'</b></a></span>.  The mosquito repellent Deet, which is widely used by holidaymakers and residents in warm climates, is losing its effectiveness, scientists say.</p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s7">The Editor says...</span><span class="s8"><br>
</span>Nobody makes such claims about DDT.  DDT kills mosquitoes, while Deet just diverts them to someone else.</p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.irishexaminerusa.com/mt/2013/01/29/war_on_poverty_as_senseless_as.html"><b>War On Poverty As Senseless As War On Drugs</b></a></span>.  Thanks to the ban on DDT, malaria has resurfaced and millions of Africans have died.  Within two years of restarting DDT programs, South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia, Madagascar, and Swaziland slashed their malaria rates by 75% or more.  Other countries want to launch similar programs, but they are facing opposition from Europe.  The E.U. is warning of possible agricultural export sanctions against Uganda, Kenya, and other countries that use DDT to save lives.  Now why on earth would the E.U. object to this life-saving measure for the African nations who rely greatly on their exports to Europe?</p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s3"><a href="http://directorblue.blogspot.com/2009/03/genocide-in-green.html"><b>Genocide in Green</b></a></span>.  [Scroll down]  In World War II, U.S. troops used to lather up with DDT.  Years ago, Dr. J. Gordon Edwards wrote:  "[In 1944,] I was ordered to dust every soldier in our company with [DDT].  For two weeks I dusted the insecticide on soldiers and civilians, breathing the fog of white dust for several hours each day.  The body lice were killed, and the DDT persisted long enough to kill young lice when they emerged from the eggs...  Fortunately, no human beings have ever been harmed by DDT."</p>
<p class="p17"><span class="s3"><a href="http://sepp.org/twtwfiles/2013/TWTW%20-%201-19-13.pdf"><b>More about the history of DDT</b></a></span>:  In 1972, EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus banned the use of DDT on the scientifically unsupported claim that it may cause cancer in humans.  By then, malaria was no longer a health issue in the US.  Using this claim, certain US government agencies and environmental nongovernment organizations (NGOs) demanded the banning of all use of DDT in other countries, including indoor spraying, as a condition for receiving US governmental aid.  In countries that did so, malaria rates soared, millions died, and hundreds of millions suffered from preventable malaria.</p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/apr/20/earth-days-dark-side-789496388/"><b>Earth Day co-founder written out of history</b></a></span>.  [Scroll down]  DDT was banned for agricultural use in the United States in 1972, and its use was greatly reduced worldwide after the publication of Rachel Carson's 1962 scare book, "Silent Spring,"which warned of DDT and other chemicals in food and water.  It's nice that bald eagles are making a comeback, but on the list of things ravaged, add millions of people dead of malaria in the Third World since DDT was banned for agricultural use.  In 2010, more than 600,000 people, mostly children, died in Africa of malaria, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://finance.townhall.com/columnists/maritanoon/2012/03/26/green_is_taking_us_for_a_ride"><b>Green is Taking Us for a Ride</b></a></span>.  While malaria is no longer a concern for America, such is not the case for developing countries.  Since DDT was banned in 1972, malaria has become Africa's largest killer — billions have been stricken by malaria and tens of millions have died.  The science that caused DDT to be banned is spotty at best, the decision to ban DDT was admittedly political, and many who originally opposed DDT now acknowledge that it is the most powerful, long-lasting mosquito repellant ever invented and has been proven to virtually eliminate malaria — yet environmental groups still oppose its use.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://finance.townhall.com/columnists/maritanoon/2012/01/15/epa_is_binge_gambling_with_us_economy"><b>EPA is Binge Gambling with US Economy</b></a></span>.  Since DDT was used in WWII to successfully control typhus and malaria, it has gone from winner to loser and back to winner again.  In 1948, Dr. Paul Muller, the scientist who discovered the insecticidal properties of DDT, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.  The tables turned when Rachel Carson wrote <i>Silent Spring</i> in 1962 and referenced experiments done that claimed DDT thinned birds' eggshells.  Ultimately, through the work of EDF, DDT was banned in 1972.  Because of that decision, malaria has spread, and millions have died from it.  Instead of eliminating the disease's vector, the mosquito, drugs have been developed to treat the disease, and those drugs are now proving ineffective, as malaria has grown resistant to them.  Since then, additional studies have been done and the eggshell findings have been revisited.  DDT wasn't the problem it was once believed to be.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2011/11/how_the_epa_is_like_ddt.html"><b>How the EPA Is Like DDT</b></a></span>.  Though synthesized in 1874, the insecticidal properties of DDT were not discovered until 1939, the outbreak of WWII in Europe.  DDT was a boon to humanity when first used to kill vectors that spread human diseases.  GIs welcomed "showers" of DDT to rid themselves of lice and other insects.  When prisoner of war and concentration camps were liberated, the freed inmates were doused with DDT.  By the early 1950s, British colonial doctors were using DDT to control the scourge of the tropics, malaria, as well as other insect-borne diseases, by spraying the inside of huts with this persistent chemical about once every six months.  Malaria rates plummeted.  It was an inexpensive way to control a disease that killed millions and left many of the survivors partially disabled whenever they suffered outbreaks.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/38337"><b>The Greens Just Love Us to Death</b></a></span>.  You may recall [the environmentalists] got off to a strong start when the Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970.  Its first act was to ban DDT and the result of that has been the needless death of millions who could and should have been protected against malaria.  The nation these days is experiencing a bed bug population explosion that could be stopped in six months if the EPA would only authorize a pesticide to kill the critters.  They won't.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/06/a_nutshell_history_of_climate-change_hysteria.html"><b>A Nutshell History of Climate-Change Hysteria</b></a></span>.  Up until at least the mid-1970s, the frenzy to rescue the planet from industrial chemicals, especially pesticides like DDT, was fueled by Rachel Carson's alluring book <i>Silent Spring</i>.  This work, published in 1962, sparked the modern environmental movement, providing activists with both a laudable goal (cleaning up the planet) and reprehensible ones (portraying industry and modern society as enemies).  <i>Silent Spring</i> made it rather obvious to some that the modern industrial society needed to be disarmed of its "weapons" (synthetic chemicals).  Regardless of the fact that it is the careless practices of industry and the wasteful excesses of society that should have been precisely targeted, not modernity per se, the battle to save the planet was on.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/06/racism_injustice_and_the_left.html"><b>Racism, Injustice, and the Left</b></a></span>.  Every 45 seconds in Africa, a child dies from malaria, yet we continue to ban DDT, the single most effective weapon against the cause of the disease, because we worry about its effect on birds.  You would think the needless death of 700,000 black children every year, because of rabid environmentalism, would make the papers, but it doesn't.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/260862/don-t-rush-ban-chemicals-jon-entine"><b>Don't Rush to Ban Chemicals</b></a></span>.  Consider the case of California almonds.  A natural chemical, aflatoxin, is found in 15 percent of this crop and on other nuts as well.  If the aflatoxin is not eliminated before the nuts are consumed, people could die; and the most effective way to eliminate aflatoxin in nuts is with pesticides — triazines, such as simazine and atrazine, which have been found safe at levels up to 1,000 times what humans are exposed to when they're used on nuts.  But many environmental campaigners, citing controversial studies on frogs, lobby for a ban of triazines.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/33534"><b>Environmentalist fraud and manslaughter</b></a></span>.  Many chemotherapy drugs for treating cancer have highly unpleasant side effects — hair loss, vomiting, intense joint pain, liver damage and fetal defects, to name just a few.  But ... the drugs' benefits vastly outweigh their risks.  They save lives.  We need to use chemo drugs carefully, but we need to use them.  The same commonsense reasoning should apply to the Third World equivalent of chemotherapy drugs:  DDT and other insecticides to combat malaria.  Up to half a billion people are infected annually by this vicious disease, nearly a million die, countless survivors are left with permanent brain damage, and 90% of this carnage is in sub-Saharan Africa, the most impoverished region on Earth.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/10/regulators-usa"><b>The EPA: 40 and past its prime</b></a></span>.  [Lisa] Jackson lauds the EPA's protecting the public from chemical pesticides.  In fact, this is one of the agency's <i>bêtes noirs</i>.  The testing required is excessively burdensome and the tolerances permitted by regulators overly conservative (low).  What makes regulators' approach to chemical pesticides verge on the absurd is the fact that 99.99% of consumers' exposure to pesticides comes not from agricultural applications, but from substances that are naturally found in food.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2011/01/outwitting_lethal_government_p.html"><b>Outwitting Lethal Government Policies</b></a></span>.  [Scroll down]  If you live on the Texas border, or in fact anywhere in the Southwest, pay close attention to epidemics breaking out across the line.  As of 2010, we may add southern Florida to this list.  In July 2010, the Centers for Disease Control released the results of a study showing that up to 20% of the inhabitants of the Keys had been exposed to Dengue Fever, also known as "bonebreak fever" for the pain it causes.  Dengue is returning to endemic status in Texas after being banished by DDT.</p>
<p class="p15"><br></p>
<p class="p14"><span class="s3"><a href="http://canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/28875"><b>The Slow Death of the Environmental Movement</b></a></span>.  Today there are so many environmental organizations and groups that you need a directory to sort them out.  These groups, however, are now far more political than their original intent.  They are ministries of misinformation, disinformation, and outright scare mongering.  The movement as we know it today got a boost with the publication in 1962 of Rachel Carson's book, "Silent Spring."  It was an anti-pesticide diatribe whose claims have long since been disproved, but it set in motion a tsunami of fears regarding all chemicals and, beyond that, concerns about all kinds of manufacturing and technology; indeed anything involving energy resources.  Within eight years of the book's publication President Nixon initiated the Environmental Protection Agency that has since metatisized into a rogue government agency intent on controlling all aspects of life in America.</p>
