Textbook: class notes,

We  have quizes and homework graded every week, about 50 pts a week.
Three midterms in class are given, about 75 pts each. Extra pts are given for
work in  class.  To get A, one has to get at least 90% of the maximal score.
Here are lower limits for other grades:
A-    86 2/3 %,
B+    83 1/3 %,
B         80 %,
C+    76 2/3 %,
C-    73 1/3 %,
D          60%.

No make-ups are given for missing tests unless e-mail sent  to
vstein@math.psu.edu before the test.
Partial credit for late tests is given.
No points will be given after classes are over.
