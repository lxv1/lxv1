ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT
Mathematics Department


"Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, . . . 
facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized prior 
possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously 
used without informing the instructors, or tampering with the academic work of 
other students . . . .  A student charged with academic dishonesty will be given 
oral or written notice of the charge by the instructor.  If students believe they 
have been falsely accused, they should seek redress through informal discussions 
with the instructor, department head, dean or campus executive officer.  If the 
instructor believes that the infraction is sufficiently serious to warrant the 
referral of the case to Judicial Affairs, or if the instructor will award a final 
grade of F in the course because of the infraction, the student and instructor will 
be afforded formal due process."
