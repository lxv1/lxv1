<p>Let $\pi$ be an automorphic representation of a split reductive algebraic
    group $G$ over a number field $F$.&nbsp; Langlands has associated to $G$ a
complex    Lie group $^LG$, and defined, for every finite dimensional representation
    $r$ of $^LG$, an $L$-function $L(\pi,r,s),$ which is conjectured to have
   analytic properties similar to those of the Riemann zeta function and/or
  Dirichlet $L$-functions, and contain interesting information about the
representation     $\pi.$&nbsp; In the Rankin-Selberg method, analytic properties
of $L$-functions     are proved by expressing the $L$-functions in terms
of integrals containing     Eisenstein series, whose analytic properties
are known.&nbsp; We will consider     a new integral on the similitude orthogonal
group GSO(8), in which the  representations   $r$ that arise are the standard
and half-spin representations  of SO(8,C),   and use it to relate poles of
$L$-functions with the existence  of a non-trivial   functorial lift to the
exceptional group $G_2.$<br>

<p><i><b>Two elementary results concerning rational polynomials </b></i><br>
                  </p>
                     
<p>The two elementary results in the title are part of my recent work. Both
  have to do with the wonderful fact that in polynomials with integer coefficients
  both the coefficients and the powers are taken from essentially the same
 set. Most of the talk will be accessible to most graduate students.<br>
                 </p>
             
<p>The first result is the following theorem.<br>
         </p>
             
<p>Theorem. A polynomial with rational coefficients divides a derivative of
the polynomial which is split over rationals if and only if all of its irrational
roots are real and simple.<br>
             </p>
             
<p>I will explain the motivation as well as the proof of this result, which
  resembles the famous three point theorem of Belyj.  The second result is
 related to the classification of the set of solutions of the system of functional
  equations satisfied by the so-called quantum integers with respect to multiplication.<br>

<p><i><b>Paucity Problems</b></i></p>
           
<p>In analogy with Fermat's Last Theorem, one typically expects that a diophantine
  equation in few variables (relative to the degree) will have few, if any,
  non-trivial solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; When counting the number of solutions in a box,
 one can frequently show that the number of non-trivial solutions grows more
 slowly than the number of trivial ones as the size of the box tends to infinity,
  and in this case we say that the equation (or system of equations) exhibits
  a "paucity" of non-trivial solutions.&nbsp; We will present several examples
of  this phenomenon in symmetric systems and discuss some recent results
in this  direction.<br>

<p><b><i>Diophantine Approximation on Planar Curves</i></b></p>
 
<p>Let $\cal C$ be a non--degenerate planar curve and for a real, positive
decreasing function $\psi$ let $\cal C(\psi)$ denote the set of simultaneously
$\psi$--approximable points lying on $\cal C$. In joint work with Beresnevich,
Dickinson and Velani, we show that $\cal C$ is of Khintchine type for divergence;
i.e. if a certain sum diverges then the one-dimensional Lebesgue measure
on $\cal C$ of $\cal C(\psi)$ is full. We also obtain the Hausdorff measure
analogue of the divergent Khintchine type result.&nbsp; In the case that $\cal
C$ is the unit circle the convergence counterparts of the divergent results&nbsp;
are&nbsp; also obtained. &nbsp;Furthermore, for functions $\psi$ with lower order in
a critical range we determine a general, exact formula for the Hausdorff
dimension of $\cal C(\psi)$.&nbsp; These results constitute the first precise
and general results in the theory of simultaneous Diophantine approximation
on manifolds.<br>

difference $\pi(x;4,3)-\pi(x;4,1)$ changes sign infinitely many times, for
the general modulus it is still not known that $\pi(x;q,a) - \pi(x;q,b)$ changes
signs for arbitrarily large $x$ when $(a,q) = (b,q) = 1$.&nbsp; We survey the

<p><i><b>Partitions with Short Sequences and Ramanujan's Mock Theta Functions
</b></i><br>
   </p>
     
<p>In a recent paper "Integrals, Partitions and Cellular Automata" in the
Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Holroyd, Liggett and Romik
evaluated an intriguing definite integral and applied it to a variety of probability
models.&nbsp; The application to integer partitions concerned partitions in which
no sequence of consecutive integers of length k appears (k=2,3,...).&nbsp; The
authors note that in one instance, a proof of their result can also be based
on a little known partition theorem of P.A. MacMahon.&nbsp; Our object in this
talk will be to introduce these ideas and to develop the study of such partitions
from a purely combinatorial, q-series point of view.&nbsp; Surprisingly one of
Ramanujan's mysterious mock theta functions arises.<br>
