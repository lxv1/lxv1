   <b><i>Weierstrass Points on X_0(pM) and Supersingular j-invariants</i></b><br>
   <br>
   Abstract: Weierstrass points are special points on a Riemann surface that 
 carry a lot of information. Ogg studied such points on X_0(pM) (for M such 
 that the genus of X_0(M) is 0 and prime p not dividing M) and proved that 
 the reduction of Weierstrass points on X_0(pM) is supersingular mod p. In 
 this talk we show that, for square free M on the list, all supersingular 
j-invariants are uniformly covered this way. Furthermore, In most cases where 
M is prime we describe the explicit correspondence between Weierstrass points 
and supersingular j-invariants. Along the way we also generalize a useful 
formula of Rohrlich for computing a certain Wronskian of modular forms modulo 
p.<br>

<p><i><b>Ramanujan and Partial fractions</b></i><br>
 </p>
 
<p>Ramanujan's Lost Notebook is filled with mysteries. A valuable project 
is the attempt to understand the underlying methods Ramanujan used for the 
unproved formulas that populate the Lost Notebook. In the early 1980's, I 
wrote a lengthy paper, The Mordell integrals and Ramanujan's "lost" notebook.(in 
Lecture Notes in Mathematics #899, Springer-Verlag,  NY, pp. 10-48). In that 
paper I proved a long list of formulas from the Lost Notebook using a cumbersome 
method based on the maximum modulus principle. Recent investigations have 
led me to the conclusion that an entirely different method based on partial 
fractions must be closer to what Ramanujan had in mind.   I hope to provide 
a historical account of these developments and to supply examples to contrast 
the first method with the second. <br>

<p><i><b>New Views of Binary Partition Functions<br>
 </b></i></p>
 
<p>Mike Hirschhorn and I recently proved that the number of partitions of 
n into parts which are powers of 2 (i.e., the number of binary partitions 
of n) is equal to the number of partitions of n wherein the parts satisfy 
a certain system of inequalities. The proof is quite straightforward and will
be given in the talk. In December 2003, Neil Sloane and I teamed up to work
on problems involving "non-squashing" partitions (which I will define in
the talk) and have found interesting connections between these "non-squashing" 
partitions and the binary partitions mentioned above. I will describe these 
connections and prove some related results.<br>

 Recently, P. Corvaja and U. Zannier have used W.M. Schmidt's Subspace Theorem 
to give a new proof of a celebrated theorem of Siegel's on the finiteness 
of the set of integer points on a curve of positive genus.  I plan to sketch

<p>If A is an abelian subvariety of J_0(N), then some of its Shafarevich-Tate 
group might be visible in J_0(N).  However, there are many examples in which 
some of the Shafarevich-Tate group is not visible in J_0(N).  One can hope 
that such Sha is visiblit in J_0(N*M), for some integer M, but very little 
is known about what is actually true. In this talk I'll recall the basic
motivation for modular abelian variety and visibility of Shafarevich-Tate
groups, then discuss some current work on visibility in modular Jacobians,
with a particular emphasis on the situation when an element of Sha is invisible
in J_0(N), but visible at some higher level N*M.<br>

<p><i><b>Iwasawa Invariants of Arithmetically Equivalent Number Fields</b></i><br>
 </p>
 
<p>Let p be a prime number.  In 1956 Iwasawa gave a celebrated formula for 
the p-parts of the class numbers of the fields K_n forming a Z_p tower of 
a number field K:  There are integers lambda, mu, and nu for which the p-part 
of the class number of K_n is p^e with e given by<br>
 <br>
    e =lambda times n  +  mu times p^n  +  nu<br>
 <br>
 for all sufficiently large indices n.  The constants lambda, mu, and nu
are the Iwasawa invariants of the Z_p tower.<br>
     One particular Z_p tower of L is the cyclotomic Z_p tower obtained from 
appropriate subfields of the fields of p-power roots of unity over L.  Ralph 
Greenberg has asked:  If K and L are arithmetically equivalent (have identical 
Dedekind zeta functions), do the cyclotomic Z_p extensions of K and of L have
the same Iwasawa invariants?  In 1983 K. Komatsu gave an affirmative answer,
but his paper lacks a precise statement of hypotheses and omits crucial steps
in the proof.  <br>
    This talk is to discuss the problem and some generalizations, and to
salvage at least large pieces of Komatsu's assertions.<br>

<p><b>Note Special Time and Place: Friday, 2:30 pm, 115 Mcallister.</b> </p>
 
<p>I will describe some recent work with G. Lachaud where we prove a general 
inequality for estimating the number of points of arbitrary complete intersections 
over a finite field. This extends a result of Deligne for nonsingular complete 
intersections. For normal complete intersections, this inequality generalizes 
the classical Lang-Weil inequality. I will also describe an effective version 
of the Lang-Weil inequality for arbitrary affine as well as projective varieties. 
An attempt to explain and elucidate some related conjectural statements of 
Lang and Weil, and recent results concerning them, will also be made.<br>
 <br>
 I will try to explain some of the background and keep the prerequisites
at a minimum. <br>

<p><i><b>The Andrews-Stanley Partition Function and p(n)</b></i><br>
 </p>
 
<p>Let pi be a partition of n and pi' its conjugate.  Define O(pi)  to be 
the number of odd parts in the partition pi.  Work of R. Stanley has led
to a new partition statistic, O(pi) - O(pi').  In a recent paper, G. E. Andrews 
examines partitions in terms of O(pi) and O(pi'), and obtains results about 
a new partition function t(n), which counts partitions pi for which O(pi) 
is congruent to O(pi') modulo 4.  Andrews' paper brings up the question "What 
is the relationship between t(n) and p(n)?"  In this talk I will examine
two different aspects of this question.  First I will address the growth
of t(n), proving an asymptotic formula relevant to that for p(n).  Then I
will discuss the issue of congruence properties for t(n).<i><b><br>

<p><i><b>On the canonical coordinates on the moduli space of Calabi-Yau varieties<br>

<p>It is predicted by the Mirror Symmetry Conjecture that the power series 
expansion for the canonical coordinates on moduli space of   Calabi-Yau varieties 
near a boundary point with maximal unipotent local monodromy should have integral
coefficients.  This is a higher-dimensional generalization of the classical
fact that the Fourier coefficients of the j-invariant are integers.  I will
explain a proof of this Integrality Conjecture.<br>
