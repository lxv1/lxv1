Bayesian Methodology for Detecting and Estimating Regime
Change Points and Variable Selection in Multiple Regression Models
for Marketing Research

Abstract. Multiple regression is one of the most frequently utilized 
multivariate statistical procedures applied in the Marketing Research arena 
for examining the impact of one or more independent variables upon a 
designated dependent variable. The estimated regression coefficients denote 
the contribution of changes in the levels of the independent variables upon 
the dependent variable. With time series or longitudinal data, these 
contributions are typically assumed constant over the entire data collected 
for the particular study at hand. However, as is known in many such 
Marketing applications, the effects of such independent variables may 
change over the course of the time period investigated. Also, in many 
surveys involving repeated measures, fatigue, order effects, learning, 
patterned responses, etc. may also lead to alterations in the contributions 
of these independent variables over the sequence of administration. We 
present a Bayesian change point multiple regression methodology for such 
studies which, for a fixed number of change points, simultaneously 
estimates the location of change points in time/sequence, the corresponding 
relevant subset of independent variables per regime, and the associated 
regression parameters of these selected independent variables per regime. 
Furthermore, a probability based model selection heuristic, the Bayes 
factor, is derived in this particular modeling context to determine the 
appropriate number of change points in the data. An application involving 
actual time series data involving prescription sales for an ethical drug is 
utilized to demonstrate the methodology.  Finally, we discuss directions 
for future research.

Biography: Duncan K. H. Fong is Professor of Marketing and Professor of 
Statistics at The Pennsylvania State University where he has been on the 
faculty since 1987. He holds a Ph.D. in statistics from Purdue University. 
His research interests include marketing research, Bayesian statistics, 
experimental economics, forecasting and supply chain management. He is 
currently working on several projects, which include the development of new 
methodologies to perform conjoint analysis, the investigation of dynamic 
evolution of consumer preferences, the study of regime changes with an 
application to multiple regression analysis, among others. He has been 
active in research and is the author or co-author of more than thirty 
articles published in various academic journals. Professor Fong is an 
Associate Editor of ISBA Bulletin, the official publication of the 
International Society for Bayesian Analysis, from March 2001 to June 2004. 
He is also a Founding member of the International Society for Bayesian 
Analysis and served on the Board from 1992 to 1994. He has supervised four 
doctoral dissertations, one master thesis and one undergraduate honors 
thesis. Furthermore, he has served on seventeen Ph.D. and twelve MS 
students' committees. He teaches business statistics and marketing research 
courses to undergraduate, MBA, M.S. and Ph.D. students.
