<P CLASS="western"><B>Abstract:</B> Residential penetration of 
broadband Internet access, both DSL and cable, is growing very
rapidly.  Furthermore, technology may soon expand available access
bandwidth from about a maximum of 10Mbps today to 100Mpbs in the near
future.  Demand for broadband access is fueled by the desire for
&ldquo;value-added&rdquo; services (such as interactive gaming,
emerging peer-to-peer applications, IP telephony, etc.) and by the
affordable additional cost of subscription over dial-up access.  We
will discuss the commercial and cyber security concerns of such a
dramatic increase in residential broadband access (RBA). A &ldquo;first
hop diffserv&rdquo; architecture is proposed so that the
infrastructure providers of RBA can recover costs from the
value-added services they enable, and also address security concerns,
by offering a premium service that is more reliable. Specifically, we
focus on the packet memories feeding the links connecting the
first-PoP layer-3 routers of the RBA provider to the Internet. A
differential enqueue policy is devised and the dynamics of user
access are studied when there is congestion (excess demand) in the
memory.</P>

received his M.S. and Ph.D. in EECS from U.C. Berkeley in 1990 and
1992 respectively.&nbsp; He was a professor in the E&amp;CE Dept of
the University of Waterloo, Canada, from 1992 to 2000. Since April
2000, he has been an associate professor in both the EE and CS&amp;E
Depts of the Pennsylvania State University.&nbsp; In 1999, he took a
sabbatical with Nortel Networks, Ottawa, to work, in particular, on
low-complexity traffic measurement and estimation and on bandwidth
scheduling for MPLS.&nbsp; In 2001, he was part time member of
technical staff at Mahi Networks working on embedding algorithms in
the data plane of their multi-protocol router.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

addition to a book on ATM networking, Prof. Kesidis has authored
papers on&nbsp;the following topics related&nbsp; to communication
networks: effective bandwidths and traffic modeling, quick
simulation, traffic multiplexing (scheduling) algorithms, traffic
shaping, traffic measurement and estimation, network resources
provisioning for QoS, TCP-friendly active queue management (AQM),
network pricing and billing, and modeling and traceback of malicious
behavior (network security).&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-top: 0.18cm; margin-bottom: 0.18cm"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">His
current research also includes the following problems in wireless ad
hoc networking: network self-organization, energy efficient routing,
energy efficient medium access control and scheduling, mobility
management for sensor networks, and intrusion detection. Currently,
he is on the technical program committees of 2004 IEEE INFOCOM (Hong
Kong) and 2004 IEEE ICC (Paris) and he will be TPC co-chair of
INFOOCM 2007. George Kesidis is a senior member of the IEEE. </FONT>
