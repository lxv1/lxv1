            Reviews and Commentary 
            We love reading reviews-and the more of them, the better. We didn?t write the review below (other people did), but we thought you?d be interested
            in their comments.

            From The Publisher: 
            This is the guide that tells when, where and how to find delicious
            edible mushrooms and how to avoid poisonous ones. Beginners as
            well as experts will be able to identify mushrooms in a matter of
            minutes. All of the mushrooms included are illustrated in beautiful
            color, adding visual enjoyment to the textual materials. The
            descriptions are tinged with wit and wisdom, making the use of this
            guide an enjoyable and rewarding experience.
