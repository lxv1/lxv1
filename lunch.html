<br>Subject: "Take a Professor to Lunch"
<p>Some of you may have read the editorial in this morning's COLLEGIAN
pointing
<br>out the many responsibilities faculty have as they go about their daily
<br>business.&nbsp; I would like to use the occasion of that editorial
to call
<br>attention to an issue raised there that we can do something about.&nbsp;
The
<br>article states, "Chances are you have had very few, if any, encounters
(of any
<br>kind) with your professors outside of the classroom.&nbsp; You can
probably count
<br>on one hand the number of times you have discussed with them art or
politics
<br>or life in general over lunch at the HUB ...."&nbsp; By an interesting
coincidence,
<br>we will in a few days be distributing information to our students and
to
<br>departmental offices concerning the ECoS's "Take a Professor to Lunch"
<br>Program, now in its 7th year.&nbsp; As all old-timers know, the College
will buy
<br>lunch at any of the university's eight dining halls for one or more
students
<br>and a faculty member invited to accompany them (all must be in the
College).
<br>The purpose of this very successful program is to facilitate those
<br>interactions between students and faculty that the COLLEGIAN editorial
feels
<br>are lacking and we encourage you to accept any invitations offered.
<br>Although the students will be made aware of this program separately,
it would
<br>be highly appropriate for you to announce in your classes that you
are
<br>ready and willing to be invited.&nbsp; Bon appetit!
