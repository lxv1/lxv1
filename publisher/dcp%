{\bf Why This Book Was Written}

% \noindent
% I have been teaching Math 484, Linear Programming, at Penn State since 1983.
% This course is a one-semester course carrying three credits. Most students 
% enrolled are seniors, and they have
\noindent
This text has evolved from an advanced undergraduate math course serving students with 
 different mathematical backgrounds and various majors, including mathematics, computer science, 
statistics, engineering, secondary education, actuarial science,  computer
engineering,  science, and business. Some students are in the integrated five-year science/business program leading to a Master's in Business Administration, and some are Ph.D. students.

Since this course does not require deep mathematical theories such as
calculus, differential equations, abstract algebra, topology or
number theory,
it offers an opportunity for students with modest mathematical 
backgrounds to learn some useful and important mathematics. 
With this in mind, I tried to avoid, whenever possible, deep or complicated 
mathematical concepts such as vector spaces, determinants, echelon forms,
limits, and derivatives.
 


  Many students enroll because linear programming is widely used in
 business and other areas.
They need to learn how to formulate real-life problems, how to adapt the
formulation for specific computer software, and how to interpret and apply the results of
computations 
back to   real-life problems. In the case when a computer does not
produce any result or produces nonsense, they should be able  
to adjust the problem or choose an appropriate software.

% Word problems...


There are many excellent textbooks on linear programming,
but most of them require a strong  mathematical background
and are accessible only to mathematics majors
or written for advanced students and contain much more than can be covered in a one-semester course. 

It is a real challenge to keep both advanced students and beginners in one class!
Although linear algebra is a prerequisite for linear programming at Penn State, some students in class have
difficulty solving  systems of linear equations.  
On the other hand,
some students  in class are strong in mathematics or computer science.

So I tried   to avoid texts that are
  a bit like the porridge that Goldilocks
rejected---they either presented material that was  too ``cold'' in that it was
trivialized or they presented material that was too ``hot'' in 
that it was
predicated on a rigorous mathematical background.  In 
the former case, many students
were bored; in the latter case, many students found the material to be
inaccessible.

The  text  starts from
the   beginning, assuming very little mathematical background. Thus I offer the reader
the opportunity to learn linear programming integrally by  first considering
relevant tools from linear algebra and logic before seeing  the simplex method.  
The section on logic is an important, albeit often ignored, component of linear
programming. Throughout the book, I present a rich palette of examples and
applications and I ask students to attempt exercises of differing degrees of
difficulty. Students like this approach to linear
programming, as evidenced by the enrollment and  remarks they have made on their end-of-semester
evaluation forms.

The widespread availability of computers has not eliminated the need for computational skills, but it has increased the
relative importance of logical skills. It is a curiosity rather than an
important asset, nowadays, if you can compute 100 digits of  $\pi$ by hand.
Today computers can compute the first  $10^{10}$ digits. 
But is it   logically possible to compute the $10^{100}$-th digit of $\pi$?

% Can you detect a fallacy in the following statement
% in New Yorker: p.62
% ..............computation of remote digits of $\pi$......

\noindent
{\bf How to Use This Book}

\noindent
The text is written at three levels.  Most of it
is accessible to students who even do not know linear algebra or calculus.
Remarks and some exercises are addressed to more sophisticated students.
 The appendix at the end of the book gives a general idea of
further developments
in linear and mathematical programming. It is
intended as a guide for further studies. Also it gives details on topics mentioned in Chapters 1 through 8 requiring a
stronger mathematical background and a level of experience and sophistication on the part of students that is 
beyond what is typically achieved by undergraduate students in the United States.


Many examples with solutions are given in the text, so I feel that it is not
necessary to give students solutions for numerous exercises.
However, at the end of book, answers are given to some exercises including those that  
could be tricky.  Exercises are of different difficulties, but all of them can be
solved by hand.
Computers are allowed but not required in class. I do not give
problems where  computer skills give a big advantage. 
The exercises in the first section of Chapter 1, besides checking understanding of definitions, also
test the mathematical background of students. 

% Exercises in the book can be used for various tests such as quizzes, 
% homework, midterms, and finals.
%  I suggest a quiz or homework for each section and three midterms.

{\bf     Acknowledgments and  References}

\noindent
My class notes evolved over several years, and many students and graders contributed
to their improvement by pointing out misprints and errors and asking
questions. Reviewers and editors of Prentice Hall made numerous corrections and
improvements.

I deliberately chose not to tie this book to a particular  
software package, because I  believe that if students learn the material in this text, they
can intelligently apply this knowledge when  using any one of the excellent
software packages now available.  Another reason is that any particular package
will be soon outdated with the appearance of new packages and advances in computers
and operating systems.

 However, the students in class are allowed to use
 any hardware and software they like, even during tests.  Software
that can do linear programming includes $Mathematica, Maple,$ and $Excel.$

More software for linear programming is available via the Internet
either to be downloaded for free or to be used online. There is a lot
of useful information about  linear programming on the Internet. I list
some URLs, but keep in mind that the Web changes rapidly:
