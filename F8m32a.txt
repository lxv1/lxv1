1.� Saddle point.� --> Value of the game =7
�
2.� Reduce by domination.� (c1, r5, r3, r4, c3, c5, c6 dominated)
Optimal row strategy:� (3*R1 + R2)/4
Optimal col strategy:�� (3*C2 + C4)/4
Value of the game = 7/4
[See Kelsey's paper for the correct answer. -LV]

3.�Reduce by domination. (c1, r1)
Use graphing method...
Optimal row strategy:�� (5*R3 + 3*R2)/8
Optimal col strategy:�� (5*C3 + 3*C4)/8
Value of the game = 15/8
[See Kelsey's paper for the correct answer. -LV]

4.� if t not equal to 1/4 -->� y = (6t-12)/(1-4t)� and x = 3 - t(6t-12)/(1-4t)
���� if t = 0 --> y = -12 and x = 3
���� if t = 1/4 --> infeasible [no slutions. -LV]
�
5. mean = 29/12, midrange = 4, central value =� 0
