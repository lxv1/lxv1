On simultaneously badly approximable pairs 

For any pair $i,j \geq 0$ with $i+j =1$ let $\Bad(i,j)$ denote the set of  pairs $(\a,\b) \in \R^2$ for which $ \max \{
||q\a||^{1/i}\, ||q\b||^{1/j} \} > c/q $ for all $ q \in \N $. Here $c = c(\a,\b)$ is a positive constant. If $i=0$ we identify the
set $\Bad(0,1)$ with $\R \times \Bad $ where $\Bad$ is the set of badly approximable numbers. That is, $\Bad(0,1)$
consists of pairs $(\a,\b)$ with $\a \in \R$ and $\b \in \Bad$. If $j=0$ the roles of $\a$ and $\b$ are reversed. We prove
that the set $\Bad(1,0)\cap \Bad(0,1) \cap \Bad(i,j)$ has Hausdorff dimension 2, i.e. full dimension. The method easily
generalizes to give analogous statements in higher dimensions.
