<p>Slow-Pitch Seminar
<br>Sept. 6 at 5:00pm (refreshement at 4:30)
<br>room:???
<p>Let&nbsp; <i>F</i> is a polynomial in several variables with integral
coefficients.
<br>If we are interested in integral or rational solutions of the equation&nbsp;
<i>F </i>= 0
<br>then we talk about a Diophantine equation.
<br>We can ask whether there are solutions, whether there are infinitely
<br>many solutions, or how we can describe all solutions.&nbsp; In general,
these kind
<br>of questions are undecidable.
<br>However&nbsp; these questions can be answered for some&nbsp; equations.
<br>For example, when the total degree of <i>F</i> is 1, i.e., we have
a linear equation
<br>with a nonzero <i>F</i>, then we can find a complete description of
all integral
<br>(and all rational) solutions in finitely many steps. This is true even
for
<br>any finite system of linear equations.
<br>The quadratic equations are more difficult, but still manageable, e.g.,&nbsp;
<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>+ <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>.
<br>The main goal of the talk is to describe all rational and all integral
<br>solutions of the cubic equation in the title. This is a joint work
with Rachel Gar-El.
