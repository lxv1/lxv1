The PA Space Grant Consortium of Penn State is pleased to announce a new
research program for Summer 2000.&nbsp; The MURE (Minority Undergraduate
Research Experience) program is designed to increase the retention of
minority students in science and engineering -related majors. This is
done by creating a supportive mentoring partnership between a student and
a faculty member.&nbsp; The students would work an 8-hour day for about
10 weeks.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
All interested persons, please respond by sending a <b>brief
description</b> of your research project to me by <b>April 26,
2000</b>.&nbsp; <br>
My email address is <b>wys102@psu.edu</b>.&nbsp; If there are any
questions, feel free to call me at 3-7688.&nbsp; <br>
