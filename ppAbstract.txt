Polynomial parametrization  
for the solutions of Diophantine equations 
and arithmetic groups

 

Abstract. We solve an old open  problem of Skolem and Beurkers
giving a polynomial  parametrization
of the group of integer two by two matrices with determinant one.
This implies that, for many Diophantine equations,
the integer solutions  and the primitive solutions 
admit polynomial parametrizations
