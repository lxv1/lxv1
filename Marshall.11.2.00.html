<p>Re: Auction <a href="/statements.html">research statements</a>
<p>The research statements sent to me from 17 PSU&nbsp; faculty, plus my
statement, are below - random order. The meeting has been set for Monday
November 6 at 10AM in Room 420 of Kern. Look forward to seeing your there.
<p>Let me offer two observations from these statements.
<p>1If we get to the point of writing a proposal, the composition of researchers
looks both broad and deep. Foundationally, we cover theory, experiments,
and data analysis. Also, lots of different applications. The only concern
I have is the apparent shortage of faculty in numerical analysis. (Many
auction problems are analytically intractable due to asymmetries among
the players.)
<br>2Research topics include: collusion, auctions versus bargaining, efficiency,
double auctions including automated trading in ``thick'' markets, information
acquisition on the web and its implications for auctions, multiple-unit
auctions, to name a few.
<p>I think all of these issue can be unified under the theme of&nbsp; ``auctions
and the internet''. (My colleagues in Economics are almost surely muttering
obscenities about me from this one sentence.) Here's the idea. Any research
program about auctions that was of interest prior to the existence of internet
auctions is still relevant. The web did not eliminate problems of collusion,
efficiency, whether to sell by auction versus bilaterla exchange, etc.&nbsp;
Thus, no existing research program identified below is precluded. However,
the internet poses some additional issues about the flow of information,
bundling, access, and many others that make the environment of internet
auctions potentially different from ``standard'' auctions.&nbsp; So ``auctions
and the internet'' brings in all existing research programs as well as
those dedicated to web specific issues.
<p>This is only one idea. Look forward to hearing your thoughts on Monday.
