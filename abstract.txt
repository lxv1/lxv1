Let  F is a polynomial in several variables with integral coefficients.
If we are interested in integral or rational solutions of the equation  F=0
then we talk about a Diophantine equation.
We can ask whether there are solutions, whether there are infinitely
many solutions, or how we can describe all solutions.  In general, these kind
of questions are undecidable.
However for some  equations these questions can be answered.
For example, when the total degree of F is 1, i.e., we have a linear equation
with a nonzero F, then we can find a complete description of all integral
(and all rational) solutions in finitely many steps. This is true even for
any finite system of linear equations.
The quadratic equations are more difficult, but also manageable, e.g.,
x^2+y^2 =z^2.
The main goal is to describe all rational and all integral
solutions of the cubic equation in the title. This is a joint work with Rachel Gar-El.
